The goal of this homework is to familiarize you with EKF and EKF SLAM for localization and mapping. You will also take a deeper dive into ROS and use some of the off-the-shelf tools. You will also be required to write your own nodes from scratch and start preparing code that will be useful for your final project.

Feel free to use this [Latex template](/aa274_win1819/pdfs/homework/hw.tex).
