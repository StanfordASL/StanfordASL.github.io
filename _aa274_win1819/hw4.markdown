The goal of this homework is to familiarize you with some motion planning techniques, specifically A* and RRT. The ROS problem (Problem 3) will use your A* implementation to create a collision-free path (based on your map from gmapping) from the robot's current pose to the desired goal pose. 

We encourage you to start early on this homework as this is the last pillar of your robot's autonomy stack, and you can spend more time working on extensions for your robot.
