The goal of this homework is to familiarize you with some of the techniques for controlling nonholonomic wheeled robots, and with the ROS environment. Please read the homework carefully.

We recommend that you work on this homework in a virtual machine that we provide which has all the dependencies (including ROS) preinstalled. You can find instructions for installing the VM on your system on [this google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ge94AbHGz5uqgsjbWyG7QK-7AHh-XMkchfFKmbbinNw/).
