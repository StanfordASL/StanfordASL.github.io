Problem 4 is released (Problem 0 to come). Please download the latest copy of hw3.pdf.
Problem 4 is open-ended, and is designed to make you start thinking more about the final project and what you are capable of as a roboticist!

An update on the robots and problem 0:
The TAs have been working tirelessly over the past week to get your robots up and running (all 20 of them!). It takes about 4 hours to build each one.
We plan on releasing some of the robots (roughly 10) tomorrow, and hopefully the rest on Thursday.

Please keep in mind that each robot is worth more than $5000 each, and is composed of delicate hardware. It is extremely important that you adhere to proper usage.

We will notify the class when each “robot batch” is released, as well as Problem 0.
