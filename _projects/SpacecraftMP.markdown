question: "How can we plan trajectories online for autonomous spacecraft navigation?"
blurb: "The objective of this research is to devise real-time, efficient and dependable algorithms for spacecraft autonomous maneuvering, with a focus on dynamic and cluttered environments. Specifically, we aim to devise technologies for the online planning of trajectories in proximity operations, which together with reliable environmental sensing and autonomous high-level decision-making is a key enabler for autonomous spacecraft navigation. To this end, we develop robot motion planning and trajectory optimization techniques, tailor them to aerospace mission constraints (e.g., unique dynamics and environments, often limited computation, etc.), and apply them to aerospace hardware platforms, both on ground test beds and in space."
