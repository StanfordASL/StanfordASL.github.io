question: "How can we reliably generate safe trajectories for robotic systems operating in uncertain environments?"
blurb: "Motion planning algorithms for agile robotic systems operating in uncertain environments, with application to self-driving cars, drones, and autonomous spacecraft. Emphasis is placed on real-time implementability (e.g., via massive parallelization on GPUs), on robustness (via techniques from robust model predictive control, convex optimization, and contraction theory), and on formal performance guarantees (via advanced mathematical and statistical tools)."
