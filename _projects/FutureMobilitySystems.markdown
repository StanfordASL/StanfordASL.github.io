question: "What will be the future of transportation systems?"
blurb: "Investigation of large-scale coordination algorithms for the optimization of future mobility systems, with an emphasis on autonomous mobility on demand (AMoD) â€“ a transformative and rapidly developing mode of transportation wherein fleets of self-driving vehicles transport passengers on demand within a city. Emphasis is placed on accounting for the couplings with other modes of transportation (in the context of an intermodal transportation system) and with other infrastructure (e.g., the power network). This line of research involves collaborations with a number of industry partners, from conceptual studies all the way to field deployments."
