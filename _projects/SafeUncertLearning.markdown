question: "How can we predict and react to rare but potentially disastrous events?"
blurb: "Theoretical foundations of risk-sensitive decision-making and learning. Deployment of safety-critical systems in uncertain environments requires predicting and reacting to rare but potentially disastrous event. Our group focuses on devising risk-sensitive algorithms for various types of real world scenarios. This includes projects to devise algorithms for risk-sensitive planning, for inferring the profile of a risk-sensitive expert (e.g., inverse reinforcement learning, imitation learning), for interactive decision making for self-driving cars (e.g., for traffic weaving scenarios), for safe transfer of control policies from simulation environments to the real world (e.g., autonomous driving in varying weather conditions), and new techniques to merge formal methods with stochastic optimal control and deep learning for high-confidence implementation on safety-critical systems."
