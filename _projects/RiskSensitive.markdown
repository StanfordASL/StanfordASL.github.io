Theoretical foundations of risk-sensitive planning, learning, and control for robotics systems. This includes projects to devise algorithms for interactive decision making for self-driving cars (e.g., for traffic weaving scenarios), methods for safe transfer of control policies from simulation environments to the real world (e.g., to grasp complex objects), and new techniques to merge formal methods with stochastic optimal control and deep learning for high-confidence implementation on safety-critical systems.
