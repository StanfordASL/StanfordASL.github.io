<h1>ASL: Reference Guidelines</h1>
<h3> Updated: Dec. 11, 2017</h3>

<b>Jump to: </b> <a href="#calendar"> Lab calendar</a>, <a href="#pcard">Reimbursements and P-Card Guidelines</a>,  <a href="#travel">Travel reimbursement guidelines</a>, <a href="#bib">ASL Bibliography</a>, <a href="#it">Lab IT</a>, <a href="#github">GitHub access</a>.

<h2 id="pcard">Lab calendar</h2>
<p align="justify"> The lab has a shared Google Calendar for lab meetings and talks. You may find a web version <a href="https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=s9h58chpc8cmcgedjk1o15sjfg%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America%2FLos_Angeles">here</a>. We highly recommend that you add the calendar to iCal, Outlook, or your calendar software by using <a href="https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/s9h58chpc8cmcgedjk1o15sjfg%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics">this link</a>.</p>


<h2 id="pcard">Reimbursements and P-Card Guidelines</h2>

<p align="justify">Use of the P-Card for lab expenses is generally highly recommended. Because of tax reporting, inventory, and regulatory requirements, and to simplify reconciliation, the Purchasing Card <b>cannot</b> be used in the following circumstances:
<ul>
<li> Personal Expenses</li>
<li> Fabrications</li>
<li> Hazardous Materials</li>
<li> Travel</li>
<li> Student Conference Registration</li>
<li> Cash Advances</li>
<li> Laboratory Animals</li>
<li> Purchases paid via PayPal</li>
<li> Purchases on Ebay</li>
<li> Any Purchase Over $4,999.99 (Note: The item cost includes tax, shipping,
handling and installation, if applicable).</li>
</ul>
For further information about these restrictions, contact <a href="mailto:rnquiroz@stanford.edu?Subject=P-Card%20Guidelines">Renee</a>.
</p>
<p>While use of the P-Card is strongly encouraged whenever possible, most small expenses (including lab meeting food) can also be charged to personal cards. Whenever submitting a reimbursement request for a non-travel payment made with a personal card, you should provide Renee with a completed copy of the <a href="../guides/docs/CertificationAuthorizedExpenses.pdf">expense certification form</a> signed by Marco. For travel expenses, see <a href=#travel>below</a>.</p>

<h2 id="travel">Travel reimbursement guidelines</h2>
<p align="justify">You may find Stanford's travel reimbursement guidelines <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/group/fms/fingate/staff/travel/index.html">here</a>. In particular:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The student travel certification form is <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/group/fms/fingate/docs/certification_student.pdf">here</a></li>
	<li>Guidelines for air travel are <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/group/fms/fingate/staff/travel/air.html">here</a>.</li>
	<li>Guidelines on the Fly America Act (which affects anyone funded by a federal agency, e.g. NSF or ONR) are <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/group/fms/fingate/staff/travel/policy_notes/fly_america_act.html">here</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="bib">ASL Bibliography</h2>
<p align="justify"> When writing a paper, you should use the lab's shared bibliography, hosted on our SVN repository (Segovia) under /bib/. There are strict guidelines on how to add papers to the bibliography. You may find the full guidelines on SVN: a (possibly outdated) version of the guidelines can be found <a href="Stanford ASL Bib Standards v1.0.2.pdf">here</a>. Here are the ten cardinal rules of the ASL bibliography:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use <tt>main.bib</tt> for non-ASL references, and use <tt>ASL_papers.bib</tt> for ASL references.</li>
<li>Use Jabref 3.8.X with ASL lab preferences imported.</li>
<li>Check references marked <tt>\color{red}</tt> by going back to the original source.</li>
<li>Use the actual documents or publisher’s website to gather information.</li>
<li>Use your SUNet ID name to mark yourself owner of new or modified entries.</li>
<li>Use the correct entry types.</li>
<li>Properly format fields and strings.</li>
<li>Use only strings for <tt>month</tt>, <tt>journal</tt>, <tt>publisher</tt>, <tt>institution</tt>, <tt>organization</tt>, and <tt>school</tt> fields (also <tt>booktitle</tt> for <tt>@inproceedings</tt> and <tt>title</tt> for <tt>@proceedings</tt>).</li>
<li>Autogenerate bibtexkeys, but do not regenerate bibtexkeys for entries that are no longer marked <tt>\color{red}</tt>.</li>
<li>Do not take entries marked <tt>\color{red}</tt> as an indication of how to choose entry types and format fields. In most cases they are wrong.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<h2 id="it">Lab IT</h2>
<p align="justify">You may find a guide to the lab's IT resources <a href="../guides/ASL_IT">here</a>.</p>


<h2 id="github">Github access</h2>
<p align="justify">Similar to SVN, StanfordASL full GitHub membership should equal stanford-asl-core (perhaps including stanford-asl-alumni), with 290 students given access on a repo-to-repo basis, or on a team-wise basis if there is a large number of relevant repositories involved.</p>
