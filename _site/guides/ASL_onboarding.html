<h1>ASL: new student checklist</h1>
<h3> Updated: April 19, 2017</h3>

<b>Jump to: </b> <a href="#sunetid"> SUNetIDs</a>, <a href="#safety">safety training</a>, <a href="#desks">desks</a>, <a href="#it">lab IT</a>, <a href="LaTeX">LaTeX</a>, <a href="techwriting">writing guidelines</a>, <a href="#core">notes for core members</a>, <a href="#minors">notes for minors</a>.

<h2 id="sunetid">SUNetID</h2>

<p align="justify"> You should have a SUNetID. If you are a continuing Stanford student, you probably already have an ID. If you are a new Stanford student, you can create your account <a href="https://accounts.stanford.edu/">here</a>. If you are a non-Stanford intern, please ask Prof. Pavone to create a SUNetID for you following the instructions <a href="https://uit.stanford.edu/service/sponsorship/process">here</a>. He will need your full name, date of birth and your e-mail address.</p>

<h2 id="safety">Safety training</h2>
Before you can enter the lab, you should complete the following steps.
<ul>
<li> Complete the following courses on <a href="https://axess.sahr.stanford.edu/">AXESS</a>:
	<ol>
		<li>EHS-4200: General Safety, Injury Prevention (IIPP), and Emergency Preparedness</li>
<li>EHS-1900: Chemical Safety for Laboratories</li>
<li>EHS-2200: Compressed Gas Safety </li>
	</ol>
To access the courses, go to Axess -> STARS -> Search Catalog, and enter in the appropriate course code. If you are a Stanford student, you will have most likely already completed the general safety course. To check what courses you have completed, go to Axess -> STARS -> All Learning -> Training History.
Once you have completed each course, save a pdf (or screenshot) of the certificate that has your name on it as well as the progress (Completed). Send a copy of the certificates to the lab safety coordinator (at the time of writing, Ben Hockman).
</li>
<li>Watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9VXSAuKtkk" title="SOP for the lab's coffee machine. For any questions, ask Federico.">this video</a> on standard operating procedures for the lab's kitchen equipment.
</li>
<li>Schedule a lab-specific safety walkthrough with the lab safety coordinator, who will hand you a signed <a href="../guides/docs/LabSpecificTrainingForm_ASL.pdf">form</a>. The form should be signed by both the lab safety coordinator and the PI (Prof. Pavone).
</li>
<li>Schedule a meeting with a Stanford Health and Safety representative. At the time of writing, the contact for Durand is <!-- <a href=mailto:jmattler@stanford.edu>Jennifer Mattler</a> (jmattler) --> <a href=mailto:drp@stanford.edu>Dayna Pettit</a> (drp@). Bring the certificates of completion of the three classes above and the walkthrough form.
</li>
<li>
Finally, complete the <a href="../guides/docs/LaboratoryAccessRequestForm.docx">lab access request form</a>, obtain Prof. Pavone's signature and hand it to the Durand department manager, <a href=mailto:jscholes@stanford.edu>Jenny Scholes</a> (jscholes), in Durand 250 to obtain a code.<br>
<b>Note: </b> minors are not allowed to obtain an access code. They should still complete the safety courses and the lab walkthrough. For more information on policies for minors, click <a href=#minors>here</a>.
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="desks">Desks in the ASL</h2>

We strive to provide desk space in the lab for students doing a rotation with the ASL, although this is not always possible. 
The three-desk island immediately to the left as you enter the ASL is reserved for 290 students and visiting researchers. Space is very limited and is typically assigned on a first-come, first-served basis every quarter: check with one of the core members (if you can, Ben or Federico) to make sure the desk you want is not taken.<br>

If your research entails significant hardware activity, there may be a desk for you either in Rm. 9B (quadcopter cage) or in Rm. 10 (free-flyers).

<h2 id="it">ASL IT: SVN, GitHub, FTP, lab computers, mailing lists, Slack</h2>
<ul>
<li>The lab uses a SVN server (Segovia) to share papers, reports, and the shared lab bibliography (more on this <a href="../guides/ASL_onboarding#LaTeX">later</a>). Ask one of the ASL sysadmins (at the time of writing, Federico or Andrew) to create an user ID for you. If you are not a core member, please ask your project leader what folders you will need access to.</li>
<li>The lab's code lives in the <a href="https://github.com/StanfordASL/">ASL Github account</a>. Ask Benoit (blandry) for access. </li>
<li>The lab also has a Linux compute node (Phobos). Ask the ASL sysadmins to create an account for you.</li>
<li>Subscribe to the stanford-asl mailing list <a href="https://mailman.stanford.edu/mailman/listinfo/stanford-asl">here</a>.</li>
For more information about the ASL's IT infrastructure, see <a href="../ASL_IT.html">here</a>.
<li> We have an ASL Slack for general, unofficial discussion. Ask any lab member to be invited. There is no expectation that you monitor it, but you may find useful discussion here.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="LaTeX">LaTeX and bibliography</h2>
<ul>
<li>The ASL is strictly a LaTeX shop: all of our papers are written in LaTeX. You may write non-collaborative documents (e.g. your 290 report) in any software you like - however, if you turn it into a conference paper, you will have to rewrite it in LaTeX, so why not start the right way?
Federico recommends <a href="http://ftp.math.purdue.edu/mirrors/ctan.org/info/lshort/english/lshort.pdf">this short guide</a> for absolute LaTeX beginners - it's easier than you think. Papers are shared on SVN.</li>

<li>All collaborative documents should use the shared ASL bibliography. The bibliography is in <code>/bib/main.bib</code> on Segovia, the lab's SVN server. Please familiarize yourself with the bibliography guidelines at <code>/bib/Stanford ASL Bib Standards v[currentversion].pdf</code> . </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="techwriting">Technical Writing Guide</h2>
<ul>
Since skillful writing is a major part of being a successful researcher, new students should read the following document which includes excerpts from a widely-used technical writing textbook:<br><br>
<a href="../guides/docs/Technical_Writing_Guide.pdf">Technical Writing Guide PDF</a><br><br>
 It lays out a series of clear, practical guidelines for everything from word choice to sentence and paragraph structure, which make an enormous impact on the quality and readability of technical works. Having a clear set of writing principles saves time and will improve productivity for everyone involved on your future papers/proposals!
</ul>

<h2 id="techwriting">Paper Reviewing Guide</h2>
<ul>
Peer review is part of the backbone of academic research and can provide great value both to those under review and to the reviewers themselves. To ensure we take the best advantage of this opportunity as well as provide useful contributions to the community through our reviews, here is a guide to best practices in evaluating a paper and writing a constructive review:<br><br>
<a href="../guides/docs/TaskOfTheReferee.pdf">Paper Reviewing Guide PDF</a><br><br>
</ul>

<h2 id="core">Additional steps for core members</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Subscribe to the stanford-asl-core mailing list <a href="https://mailman.stanford.edu/mailman/listinfo/stanford-asl-core">here</a>.
<li>Send the ASL website admin (at the time of writing, Andrew or Federico) a short biography and a picture for the <a href="../people/">ASL website</a>.</li>
<li>The lab has a Google Drive team folder. Ask any lab member for access.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="minors">If you are a minor</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Unfortunately, you will not be provided with an access code to the lab, due to Stanford policy.</li>
	<li>Before you obtain a SUNetID, you and your mentor should complete all the steps outlined on <a href=https://rde.stanford.edu/conferences/minors-program>this page</a>. In particular, the mentor should register the internship with Stanford and the minor should complete the <a href=https://rde-stanford-edu.s3.amazonaws.com/ProtectionOfMinors/2017_Individual_Waiver%20%281%29.pdf><i>Assumption of Risk</i></a> and <a href=https://rde-stanford-edu.s3.amazonaws.com/ProtectionOfMinors/Medical%20Information%20Form.docx><i>Medical Information</i></a> forms.
	<!-- The document above is "What You Need to Know to Host a High School Intern/Minor", from the Office of Science Outreach. If the link is broken, Federico has an offline copy" -->
	</li>
	<li>After Prof. Pavone signs the <a href="#safety">lab-specific walkthrough form</a>, send a digital copy to the lab safety coordinator, Ben. </li>
</ul>
