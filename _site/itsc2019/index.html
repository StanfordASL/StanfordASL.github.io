          <h3>Overview</h3>
          <p>Public debate about the future of mobility and transportation is increasingly informed by predictions about the impact of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs). As AVs are approaching market-readiness, it becomes more critical that we answer questions about them:
            <ul>
              <li/>How can we design profitable and sustainable mobility systems that leverage AVs?
              <li/>What will these new forms of mobility and transportation mean for society?
              <li/>How can we ensure that such technologies benefit all members of society, improving equity rather than undermining it?
            </ul>
          This workshop will gather experts from transportation, operations research, robotics, and urban planning in order to:
          <ol>
            <li/>identify challenges and opportunities for the future of transportation that are triggered by the advent of AVs,
            <li/>identify modeling and control methodologies to address them,
            <li/>share insights from early deployments and turn such insights into an actionable research roadmap.
          </ol>

Specifically, I will discuss AMoD systems along three dimensions: (1) modeling, namely mathematical frameworks capable of capturing the salient dynamic and stochastic features of customer demand, (2) control, that is coordination algorithms for the vehicles aimed at throughput maximization, and (3) societal, entailing system-level studies characterizing the interaction between AMoD and other infrastructures, such as the electric power and public transit networks. I will conclude the talk by presenting a number of directions for future research.</p>

                    <p>Designing an efficient marketplace for ride sharing is a challenging task, since several independent systems need to respond in real time without getting in each other’s way. While the nature of supply in an autonomous world might be very different from what it is today, there are still several learnings and fundamental principles that are likely to be relevant in the future. This talk will describe how Lyft approaches marketplace design with respect to dynamic pricing, dispatch and driver positioning and how we plan for an autonomous future.</p>

                    <p>Autonomous vehicles, in recent years, quickly became one of the most popular research topics in transportation. Several scientists proposed a vision in which shared autonomous vehicles fleets would be used instead of privately owned cars and would serve the current transportation demand with an extremely reduced number of vehicles. However, the implications that such a dramatic change of paradigm would have on transportation planning itself, were neglected almost entirely so far. Multi-modal simulation tools have been enhanced to accommodate autonomous vehicles travel but, if automation will actually help shared mobility becoming prevalent, more changes to current planning approaches will be needed. We might need to look at different sets of problems, and further enhance the models we use in order to solve them. This talk, points at some simple but important aspects of individuals’ travel behavior that imply inherent limitations of existing approaches.  It also proposes ideas to adapt existing tools, or develop new ones, more suitable for a world in which autonomous shared vehicles would be the backbone of the transportation system.</p>

                    <p>This work is motivated by the possibility of a small number of autonomous vehicles (AVs) or partially autonomous vehicles that may soon be present on our roadways, and the impacts they will have on traffic flow. This automation may take the form of fully autonomous vehicles without human intervention (SAE Level 5) or, as is already the case in many modern vehicles, may take the form of driver assist features such as adaptive cruise control (ACC) or other SAE Level 1 features. Regardless of the extent of automation, changing the vehicle dynamics of a small number of vehicles in the bulk traffic flow may have substantial implications on the underlying traffic dynamics and may influence traffic stability and the development of emergent phenomena such as phantom traffic jams.</p>

<p>In this talk, I present some recent experimental work conducted to understand how AVs may be able to influence traffic flow as well as a series of experiments to understand the car following behavior of commercially available ACC vehicles. The two-vehicle car following data is collected, and models are calibrated to describe the vehicle-level ACC car following behavior. These models are then analyzed for string stability. Of the seven vehicle models tested, all are found to be string unstable. To validate the models for multi-vehicle simulations, a platoon test with seven ACC following vehicles of the same make and model is also conducted, and stability analysis of the calibrated models is conducted.</p>

                    <p>Shared autonomous vehicle (SAVs) are predicted to be a major usage model for automated vehicles. By providing driverless point-to-point service, SAV ridership costs could be similar to personal vehicle ownership. Consequently, recent studies have performed extensive simulations to investigate the effects on travel service, fleet size, and congestion. Unfortunately, a major limitation is in the dispatch strategy for matching vehicles to passengers. Vehicle routing problems are NP-hard, and the SAV problem is complicated by uncertainty in future demand. Consequently, studies have relied on heuristics but their level of optimality is unknown, which limits the generality of the simulation results. This paper investigates an analytical max-pressure policy which aims to maximize passenger throughput under stochastic demand. Although we make no claims about the optimality of waiting times, this policy is proven to maintain bounded queues of waiting passengers if at all possible. The stability region results can be used to determine the minimum fleet size needed for given average demand.</p>

In this talk I will give an overview of our work in dynamic vehicle routing for large-scale ride-sharing. Firstly, for fleet management, I will describe an anytime optimal method that is capable of online assignment of large numbers of requests to vehicles and routing them accordingly. The proposed framework includes rebalancing of idle vehicles and has been extended towards predictive routing with a model of future demand. Secondly, I will discuss a multi-objective optimisation to trade-off quality of service vs operation cost.</p>

                    <p>In past years, many of the most urgent questions related to autonomous mobility-on-demand were purely technical and vehicle centered: how safe are these vehicles, how comfortable are they, what scenarios can they handle? As public deployments worldwide are becoming more common, capabilities and limitations are becoming clearer.  On the other hand, much less confirmed knowledge is available on the operation and impact of large-scale autonomous mobility-on-demand systems with thousands of vehicles. What are the key parameters and constraints on operation? How many seats should the robotic taxis have? What will the influence on congestion be? Answering these questions is an exercise that requires not only technical know-how but also the consideration of societal and economic aspects. While much is still in the dark, research of most recent years has answered some of the open questions. This talk will provide insights into these answers of what we already know about autonomous mobility-on-demand. Moreover, it will also highlight some of the aspects which until today remain unanswered.</p>
