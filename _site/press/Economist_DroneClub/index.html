<p>“Crash-avoidance technology is another area of development. A number of groups are working on small low-powered anti-collision systems, some combining sensors with machine-learning algorithms. Ross Allen, a researcher at Stanford University, recently demonstrated a hovering quadcopter avoiding stationary objects at the same time as it dodged a fencer’s foil.”</p>
