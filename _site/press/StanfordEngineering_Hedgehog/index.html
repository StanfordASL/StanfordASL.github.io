<p>“Meet Hedgehog, who could become our guide to exploring the small bodies such as asteroids and comets whirling about the solar system. Designed by Stanford’s Marco Pavone, assistant professor of aeronautics and astronautics, and Ben Hockman, graduate student in mechanical engineering, this space rover has no wheels for rolling, no arms for grabbing and no legs for stepping. It’s just a single overgrown die with the ability to hop and tumble itself across the unknown terrain of asteroids, comets and small moons.”</p>
