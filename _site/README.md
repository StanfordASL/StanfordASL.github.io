# StanfordASL
Experimenting with the ASL's new website

## To Do:
- we need the content for the projects
- skeleton for the structure
- code tab
- Twitter Feed
- Mockup with Crayons? 
- A single image, maybe a composite one
- page title should just be the highlight on the navbar
- s3 page should have relative links
