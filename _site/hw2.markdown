The goal of this homework is to familiarize you with some tools used for perception and object detection, and integrate controls and perception nodes in ROS. Please read the homework carefully.

Part of homework 2 is to implement your ROS question from homework 1 on the TurtleBots during the ROS hours (Wed/Thurs 5-7PM in Skilling). At least one member from your group must attend to get this checked off.

You may need to install the ROS camera calibration package for Problem 1 (sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-camera-calibration).
You may need to update your Python matplotlib package (sudo pip install --upgrade matplotlib).

Feel free to use this [Latex template](/aa274/pdfs/homework/hw.tex).
