<p>The easiest way is to check out our <a class="faq-link" href="/projects/" target="_blank">projects page</a> and attend our lab meetings. Information about the lab meetings will be announced on <a class="faq-link" href="https://mailman.stanford.edu/mailman/listinfo/stanford-asl" target="_blank">this mailing list</a>. You will get to learn about topics that the lab is interested in, and an opportunity to meet students in the lab.</p>

<p>Another way to learn more about the ASL is to take the classes I teach — AA274: Principles of Robotic Autonomy, and AA203: Introduction to Optimal Control Theory.</p>
