<p>Congratulations on your admission to Stanford! In order to become a permanent member of the lab, you will need to do at least a quarter-long research rotation with the lab. Over the course of the rotation, we will see if we are a good fit for each other. The number of new students I will take each year depends on the current size of my lab, available funding sources, and how your research interests fit in with the lab’s research. Unfortunately, we get a lot of interest and we cannot accept every student.</p>

<p>Usually, I advise Master’s students to first take my classes AA 274: Principles of Robotic Autonomy (Winter) and AA 203: Introduction to Optimal Control Theory (Spring), and perform well in them, before rotating in my lab. The summer is a particularly good time to do a rotation because this allows students to focus more of their efforts on research and stress less about taking time away from courses.</p>
