Boris Ivanovic is a Ph.D. student in the Aeronautics and Astronautics Department. He obtained a Master's in Computer Science from Stanford in 2018, specializing in Artificial Intelligence (AI). Prior to joining Stanford, he obtained a Bachelor’s of Applied Science with high honors in 2016 from the University of Toronto's rigorous Engineering Science program, majoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering with a Robotics/Mechatronics minor.

His previous research work spans computer vision, machine learning, data science, and robotics. He has also conducted numerous internships, from Amazon’s Prime Air drone delivery team to a summer at ETH Zurich in Professor Raffaello d’Andrea’s Flying Machine Arena.

Boris’ research interests are rooted in trajectory forecasting for autonomous vehicles, combining deep learning with principled methods from robotics, optimization, and control theory to create performant, safe, and reliable learning-based algorithms that can be deployed in the real world.

In his spare time, Boris enjoys playing tennis, skiing, hiking, traveling, watching movies, and cooking.
