Prior to joining Stanford, he received his BS in Civil and Environmental Engineering and BA in Applied Mathematics with highest distinction from University of California Berkeley. During his time at Berkeley, Devansh developed practically efficient tools to approach a suede of problems in the water, transportation and energy spaces, including the implementation of water purification systems in slum communities in Mumbai.Devanshâ€™s current research interests span algorithmic game theory, market design and optimization. His current work is focused on the development of incentive schemes and market mechanisms for society to enable a smooth uptake of socially aware traffic routing strategies.
