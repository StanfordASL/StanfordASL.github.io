Karen has recently completed her Masters of Science in Aeronautics and Astronautics at Stanford University in 2017 and is now continuing on as a Ph.D. candidate. She received a (combined) Bachelor of Engineering and Science with First Class Honours, majoring in Aeronautical (Space) and Mathematics (Advanced) from the University of Sydney (USYD), Australia. At USYD, she worked with the Integrable Systems group on discrete Painleve equations and the impulsive control of the twisting somersault of a platform diver. Her engineering honours thesis was with the Australian Center for Field Robotics (ACFR) where she worked on control contraction analysis for nonlinear dynamical systems and geodesic computations for contraction metrics 

Karen's research interests encompass elements of robotics, control theory and machine learning and applying it to robotic systems in multi-agent interactive settings (e.g., cars swapping lanes on a highway). Currently, she is looking at long-term human behavior prediction in interactive settings. Currently, she is collaborating with the Stanford Dynamic Design Lab where she is implementing her algorithms on X1, an experimental research vehicle.

Currently, she is a co-president for Stanford Women in Aeronautics and Astronautics (WIAA). In her free time, Karen enjoys cooking, tennis, dog-spotting, scuba diving and is currently learning how to sail.
