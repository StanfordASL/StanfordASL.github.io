Karen completed her Masters of Science in Aeronautics and Astronautics at Stanford University in 2017 and is now a Ph.D. candidate. She received a Bachelor of Engineering and Bachelor of Science with First Class Honors in 2014, majoring in Aeronautical (Space) and Mathematics (Advanced) from the University of Sydney, Australia. Her engineering honors thesis was with the Australian Center for Field Robotics where she worked on control contraction analysis for nonlinear dynamical systems and geodesic computations for contraction metrics.

Karen's research interests encompass elements of robotics, control theory, and machine learning. Currently, she is studying human-robot multi-agent interactions where she is looking at using unsupervised learning techniques to identify long-term human behavior modes in the context of self-driving vehicles.

Currently, she is a co-president for Stanford Women in Aeronautics and Astronautics (WIAA). In her free time, Karen enjoys cooking, tennis, dog-spotting, scuba diving and is currently learning how to sail.
