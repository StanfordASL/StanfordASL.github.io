Gioele is a Postdoctoral Scholar in the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics at Stanford University, and an incoming faculty at MIT in Fall 2024. 
He received his BSc., MSc., and Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering with focus in Robotics, Systems and Control from ETH Zurich in 2017, 2019, and 2023 respectively. 
He spent time in Singapore as a researcher at nuTonomy (then Aptiv, now Motional), at Stanford University (working with Marco Pavone) and at MIT (in 2020 working with David Spivak, and in 2023 with Munther Dahleh). 

Driven by societal challenges, the goal of his research is to develop efficient computational tools and algorithmic approaches to formulate and solve complex, interconnected system design and autonomous decision making problems. His research interests include the co-design of sociotechnical systems, compositionality in engineering, applied category theory, decision and control, optimization, and game theory, with applications to intelligent transportation systems, autonomy, and complex networks and infrastructures. 

He is the creator of Autonomy Talks (an International seminar series promoting a diverse research exchange on autonomy), as well as a lead organizer for the seminal workshops "Compositional Robotics: Mathematics and Tools", and "Co-Design and Coordination of Future Mobility Systems" at IEEE ICRA and ITSC, respectively. 
He is the recipient of a paper award at the 4th Applied Category Theory Conference, and of the Best Paper Award (1st Place) at the 24th IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC).
