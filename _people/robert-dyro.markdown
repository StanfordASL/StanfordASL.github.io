Robert is currently pursing a PhD in the Aeronautics and Astronautics
Department at Stanford University. He received a B.S. in Aerospace Engineering
(with Honors) from UCLA in 2018.

Robert's research interests include behavior modeling and planning optimization
in robotics â€“ how to incorporate known structure into statistical models
describing the behavior of others and how to efficiently, and in real-time, plan
optimally with those models. He is interested in designing new algorithms that
perform well in practice and are computationally efficient.

When not in the lab, Robert is out running or reading, but very rarely at the
same time.
