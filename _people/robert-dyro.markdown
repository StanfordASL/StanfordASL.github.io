Robert is a second-year graduate student in the Aeronautics and Astronautics Department. Prior to coming to Stanford, he attended University of California, Los Angeles where he received his B.S. in Aerospace Engineering with a minor in Philosophy. His current research focuses on optimal control algorithms that explicitly leverage knowledge of uncertainty in learning based systems. Heâ€™s interested in how second order optimization can speed up learning and provide safety guarantees in autonomous systems.
