Stefan Jorgensen is a Ph.D. Candidate in Electrical Engineering (expected graduation early 2018). He received a B.S. in Electrical Engineering at the University of California, Los Angeles in 2013, and M.S. from Stanford University in 2015. Prior to joining Stanford, he spent three summers working on the swarms vs. swarms project with the Advanced Robotic Systems Engineering Laboratory at the Naval Postgraduate School. 

Stefan is currently developing algorithms for deployment and coordination of heterogeneous teams in risky environments. In particular, this focuses on extending vehicle routing problems to settings where vehicles can fail permanently. The key insight is to use submodularity and other tools from combinatorial optimization in order to develop relatively efficient algorithms with guaranteed performance. This work has wide applications such as environmental monitoring, delivery in dangerous environments, or search and rescue during storms.

In his free time, Stefan aspires to turn a dirt patch into a garden. Currently itâ€™s still dirt.
