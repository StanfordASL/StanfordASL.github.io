Kiril Solovey is a Postdoctoral Scholar at the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Stanford University, hosted by Prof. Marco Pavone. Prior to Stanford, he completed with honors his B.Sc., M.Sc., and Ph.D. studies in the School of Computer Science at Tel Aviv University, Israel, where he was advised by Prof. Dan Halperin.

His research interests lie at the interface of computer science and robotics. His work pursues deeper mathematical insights into the structural properties of common robotic tasks, aiming to leverage those insights in effective algorithmic approaches. Kiril's research pertains to the following three research streams, which span the full spectrum of robotics; from enhancing the autonomy of individual robots, to controlling robotic teams, to operating large-scale autonomous transportation systems.

In addition to his academic interests, he takes pleasure in being outdoors (mountain biking and hiking), traveling around the world, and enjoys food, cooking, music, books, and meditation.
