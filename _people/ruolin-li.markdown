Ruolin has joined USC as a Gabilan Assistant Professor in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering in Fall 2024. She was a postdoctoral scholar in ASL at Stanford. She obtained a Ph.D. and a M.S. degree in Mechanical Engineering from UC Berkeley in 2023 and 2018. She is broadly interested in the design and control of future mobility systems, particularly involving automated agents such as autonomous vehicles. Her research lies at the intersection of human behavior modeling, modeling of multi-agent systems, and control and optimization, aiming to enhance the societal benefits of the intelligent transportation systems. She was selected as a Rising Star in Civil and Environmental Engineering by MIT in 2021 and a Rising Star in Mechanical Engineering by Stanford in 2022.
