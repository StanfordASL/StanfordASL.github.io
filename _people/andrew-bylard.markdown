Andrew Bylard is a Ph.D. candidate in Aeronautics and Astronautics. He received his B.Eng. with a dual concentration of Mechanical Engineering and Electrical Engineering from Walla Walla University in 2014, and a M.Sc. in Aeronautics and Astronautics from Stanford University in 2016.

Andrewâ€™s research interests include geometric methods for reactive control and structured robot task planning, real-time spacecraft motion-planning, and use of gecko-inspired controllable dry adhesives for space grasping and manipulation. He has been a lead developer at the Stanford Space Robotics Facility, which houses test beds used to perform spacecraft contact dynamics experiments and demonstrate autonomous spacecraft robotics and proximity operations under simulated frictionless, microgravity conditions.

Outside work, Andrew enjoys photography, piano, drums, philosophy, history, and learning languages.

### Awards:
- NASA Space Technology Research Fellowship, 2015
