Andrew Bylard is a Ph.D. candidate in Aeronautics and Astronautics. He received his B.Eng. with a dual concentration of Mechanical Engineering and Electrical Engineering from Walla Walla University in 2014, and a M.Sc. in Aeronautics and Astronautics from Stanford University in 2016. He is currently a NASA Space Technology Research Fellow.

Andrew’s research interests include real-time spacecraft motion-planning under uncertainty, use of gecko-inspired controllable dry adhesives for space grasping and manipulation, and human-autonomy interaction for space mission planning and operations. He is currently a lead developer at the Stanford Space Robotics Facility, which houses test beds used to perform spacecraft contact dynamics experiments and demonstrate autonomous spacecraft robotics and proximity operations under simulated frictionless, microgravity conditions.

Outside work, Andrew enjoys photography, piano, drums, philosophy, learning Japanese, and eating rotten fish.
