Shreyas is an assistant professor at Georgia Tech in in the George W. Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering and a former postdoctoral scholar at Stanford's Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics. He completed his B.S. degree in mechanical engineering from Georgia Tech in 2014, and his M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in mechanical engineering from the University of Michigan -- Ann Arbor in 2020.

Shreyas' research interests include geometric and numerical representations that enable fast nonlinear optimization. His Ph.D. dissertation focused on using reachability analysis to generate such representations for robot motion planning. Currently, he is focusing on how to apply reachability analysis outside of motion planning, to robot state estimation, navigation, and perception.

In his free time, Shreyas enjoys playing guitar and motorcycling.
