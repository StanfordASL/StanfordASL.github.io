Jonas is a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics at Stanford University and Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research (BAIR) Lab at UC Berkeley. His research focuses on learning-based perception and navigation, with the goal of advancing robotics and autonomous systems. He develops algorithms that enable robots to efficiently learn, understand, and interact with the real world-leveraging reinforcement learning, foundation models, and investigaes scalable representation learning in sim and real. His broader mission is to enable robots to aid in search and rescue, firefighting, and disaster response.

Before joining Stanford, Jonas earned his Ph.D. in Robotics at the Legged Robotics Lab, ETH Zurich, and the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems. During his time at ETH Zurich, he was main lead at ETH Zurich for the Natural Intelligence (NI) European research project, established research collaboration with the University of Oxford, and NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), which he additionaly joing for an internship focusing on off-road autonomy. He also secured a research grant for an Open Data Initiative and co-led the development of ETH Zurich's GrandTour dataset project.

Outside the lab, Jonas is passionate about rowing, running, road biking and robotics.
