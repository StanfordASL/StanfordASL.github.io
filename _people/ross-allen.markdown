Ross Allen earned his Ph.D. in Aeronautics and Astronautics from Stanford University in June 2016. At Stanford, he was a UTRC Fellow in Aerospace Systems. He has also worked as a roboticist at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory and one of the first employees at Lily Robotics developing an autonomous aerial camera. Ross received his M.Sc. in Aeronautics and Astronautics at Stanford University and his B.S. in Aerospace Engineering at Illinois Institute of Technology.

Rossâ€™s work focused on training robots on how to avoid obstacles, even at high speeds, while achieving their objectives. His experiments with quadrotors evading a fencing blade while navigating an indoor environment stand as, arguably, one of the first demonstrations of real-time kinodynamic motion planning on a quadrotor systems.
