Pranit Mohnot is a PhD student in Stanford's Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics. His work primarily deals with learning-based control for safe and efficient autonomy. He is also active in the Student Advisory Committee, which liaises between the AA department and student body to improve student life and quality of education.
In 2023, Pranit graduated from UC Berkeley with Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering, with a minor in Computer Science. At Berkeley, he conducted research on robust optimal control for hybrid systems (e.g. legged robots) as part of the Hybrid Robotics Lab. Prior to that, he helped design hardware for a tech demo of Computed Axial Lithography in microgravity (and flew on a Zero-G plane!), with the Design for Emerging and Nanoscale Manufacturing Lab.
While not in the lab, Pranit can often be found playing various sports (most poorly, some decently), cooking (he is a massive cheese nerd), or generally chatting about anything and everything (with anyone).
