Hugo is a PhD student in the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics at Stanford University. He completed his BSc degree in Aerospace Engineering at Delft University of Technology in 2022 and his MSc in Aeronautics and Astronautics at Stanford University in 2024. Additionally, he held a research fellow position at Harvard University in the Computational Robotics group directed by professor Heng Yang in 2023.
Hugo’s research currently focuses on the control of high-dimensional robotics systems, leveraging both optimal control and novel learning-based architectures, with applications in bio-inspired and soft robotics. He is further interested in autonomy for space missions, and safety analysis of learning-based modules.
In his free time, Hugo enjoys watching and playing soccer, reading and traveling.
