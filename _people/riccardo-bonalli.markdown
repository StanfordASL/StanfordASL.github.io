Riccardo is a postdoctoral researcher at Stanford’s Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics. He obtained his Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics at Sorbonne Université, Paris in 2018 under a collaboration with ONERA - The French Aerospace Lab, Palaiseau, and received both his B.Sc. in Physical Engineering in 2011 and his M.Sc. in Mathematical Engineering in 2014 from Politecnico di Milano, Milan.

Riccardo’s research interests include differential geometry and Lie groups theory applied to nonlinear control systems, theoretical and numerical optimal control and optimization, homotopy and shooting algorithms, aerospace rendezvous problems, motion planning and trajectory optimization. Under a NASA grant, he is currently focusing on developing fast and robust algorithms for the optimal control of robots operating in microgravity environments.

In his free time, Riccardo enjoys skiing, political philosophy and viticulture.
