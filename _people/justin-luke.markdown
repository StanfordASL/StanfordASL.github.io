Justin is a PhD student in the department of Civil and Environmental Engineering and is co-advised by Professor Marco Pavone and Professor Ram Rajagopal (Stanford Sustainable Systems Lab). His research focuses on grid integration of autonomous electric vehicle fleets, in particular identifying synergies with renewable energy resources integration. His current projects include charging station siting and sizing, electricity pricing for fleets, and supporting grid resiliency via vehicle-to-grid (V2G) charging. Justin is supported by the Stanford School of Engineering Graduate Fellowship and <a href="https://bitsandwatts.stanford.edu">Stanford Bits & Watts</a> EV50 Project. He is concurrently completing his MS in Electrical Engineering at Stanford and obtained a BS in Energy Engineering at the University of California, Berkeley in 2018.

Justin is passionate about environmental sustainability and enjoys hiking, hockey, and playing various musical instruments in his free time.
