Justin is a PhD candidate in the department of Civil and Environmental Engineering and is co-advised by Professor Marco Pavone and Professor Ram Rajagopal (Stanford Sustainable Systems Lab). His research focuses on grid integration of autonomous electric vehicle fleets, in particular identifying synergies with renewable energy resources integration. His current projects include (1) joint optimization of charging station siting and sizing, vehicle design, and fleet operations for electric autonomous mobility-on-demand (E-AMoD), (2) real-time operations of E-AMoD via graph reinforcement learning, and (3) a digital twin framework for optimizing dispatch of electric bus fleets and battery storage to achieve a 24/7 carbon-free electrified fleet. Justin is supported by the <a href="https://bitsandwatts.stanford.edu">Stanford Bits & Watts</a> EV50 Project. He has obtained a MS in Electrical Engineering at Stanford in 2020 and a BS in Energy Engineering at the University of California, Berkeley in 2018.

Justin is passionate about environmental sustainability and enjoys hiking, hockey, and playing various musical instruments in his free time.
