Jacky is a PhD student in the Department of Computer Science at Stanford University, advised by Professors Marco Pavone and Azalia Mirhoseini. His research lies at the intersection of machine learning, systems, and robotics, with a particular focus on test-time scaling and foundation models for robotics. He is part of the Autonomous Systems Lab and the Scaling Intelligence Lab.

Before joining Stanford, Jacky received his Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees in Computer Science at UC Berkeley, where he conducted research at the Sky Computing Lab, Berkeley AI Research (BAIR) Lab, and iCyPhy Center. His master’s thesis focused on developing efficient and reliable systems for reinforcement learning and robotics under the guidance of Professors Ion Stoica and Edward Ashford Lee. Outside of research, he enjoys playing tennis, going to concerts, and skiing.
