Karthik is a postdoctoral scholar in ASL at Stanford. He recieved his Ph.D. in Aeronautics and Astronautics from MIT in 2021 and worked on the modeling and control of air transportation networks. His work has recieved several awards from the FAA / Eurocontrol conference in air trasnportation, including the 2021 Kevin Corker award for the best paper in the conference. 

Karthik's current research focuses on developing algorithms that balance multiple objectives such as efficiency, robustness, fairness, and privacy in transportation systems. He is interested in applying these algorithms to design future mobility systems, both in the ground as well as in the air.
