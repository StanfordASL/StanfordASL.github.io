Amine is a Ph.D. student in the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics. He recently obtained his M.S. degree from Stanford in 2019. Prior to joining Stanford, Amine graduated summa cum laude with a B.S. in aerospace engineering from UCLA. Before turning to robotics, he has also held multiple internships with the electric propulsion group at JPL.

Amine's research interests include motion planning, optimal control, machine learning, and robotics. His current work is focused on developing algorithms for safe robotic navigation of unknown or partially occluded environments.

Outside of the lab, Amine enjoys playing piano, soccer, and struggling to lift weights at the gym.
