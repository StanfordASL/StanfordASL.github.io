Luis is a Ph.D. student in the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics. His research lies at the intersection of machine learning and control theory, targeting advancements in robotics and autonomous systems. Luis focuses on developing algorithms that enable robots to efficiently learn from their own experience, safely interact with the world around them, and adapt to unfamiliar environments.

Prior to joining Stanford, Luis earned his B.S. in Mechanical Engineering with an Aerospace minor from the California Insitute of Technology. There, he conducted research in time-delayed control, space robotics, and autonomous exploration with both the Burdick Group and the Autonomous Robotics and Control Lab. He founded Caltech Air and Outer Space (CAOS) and held leadership roles on teams that won over $360,000 in the NASA BIG Idea Challenge (2021 and 2022). Luis has also interned at Honeywell Aerospace and the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

Outside the lab, Luis is passionate about soccer, snowboarding, reading, and making music.
