Abhishek is a PhD. candidate in Aeronautics and Astronautics. He received a BS in Aerospace Engineering from the University of Michigan in 2016 and an M.S. in Aeronautics & Astronautics from Stanford in 2018. Prior to Stanford, Abhishek interned with the GNC group at SpaceX and the ADCS group at Planetary Resources.

Abhishek's current research interests entail combining tools from trajectory optimization, optimal control, and machine learning towards problems in spacecraft robotics and systems with contact. In addition, he has worked on running experiments on the International Space Station with the Astrobee robot for grasping and control using gecko-inspired adhesives. 

In his free time, Abhishek likes watching movies, learning German, and playing tennis.
