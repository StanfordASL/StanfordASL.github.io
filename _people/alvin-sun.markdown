Alvin is a graduate student in the Mechanical Engineering department. He is currently focusing on uncertainty calibration for machine learning models and exploring how those uncertainties can be utilized in a robot autonomy stack. In general, Alvin has a broad interest that spans robotics, deep learning, computer vision, optimization, and embedded systems.

Prior to joining Stanford, Alvin graduated with highest honors from UIUC with a B.S. in Computer Engineering. At UIUC, Alvin worked in the Intelligent Motion Lab where he built real-time 3D semantic reconstruction algorithms for autonomous UV disinfection robots. Alvin has also held internships with Megvii and Skydio where he developed skills in deep visual tracking.

Outside of research, Alvin enjoys playing the piano, volleyball, skiing, and rollerblading.
