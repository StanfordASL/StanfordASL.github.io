Carmen Amo Alonso is a Schmidt Science Fellow affiliated with ASL at Stanford University. Her research lies at the intersection of control theory, machine learning, and optimization, with a focus on generative AI. Carmenâ€™s work aims to uncover and design control mechanisms in foundation models, and leverages control-theoretic principles to develop safer, more controllable AI technologies. Prior to joining Stanford, she held a postdoctoral fellow position at the Artificial Intelligence Center at ETH Zurich. Carmen earned a Ph.D. in Control and Dynamical Systems from Caltech in 2023, where she was advised by Prof. John Doyle, a M.Sc. in Space Engineering at Caltech in 2017, and a B.Sc. in Aerospace Engineering at the Technical University of Madrid in 2016. She also worked as an intern at Tesla in 2022. Besides research, Carmen is committed to education for all. As a member of Clubes de Ciencia, she travels to Mexico in the summer to teach underserved students. She also serves as the Communications and Engagement Chair of the Stanford Science Policy Group.
