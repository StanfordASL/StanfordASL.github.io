Thomas is a Ph.D. student in the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics. He completed his M.Sc. in Robotics at ETH Zürich and his B.Sc. at EPFL, Switzerland. At ETH Zürich, he worked on motion generation for legged robotics with Prof. Hutter, designed control algorithms for the student rocketry team, and worked on terramechanics for ESA's ExoMars rover at RUAG Space. He also interned at NASA JPL with Dr. Agha, where he developed resilient contact-based control algorithms for the DARPA SubT Challenge.

To enable autonomous systems to cope with uncertainty while guaranteeing safety, he is currently developing safe learning-based control and uncertainty-aware planning algorithms.
