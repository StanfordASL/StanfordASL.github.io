Rohan is a PhD candidate in the department of Aeronautics and Astronautics. His research focuses on developing methodologies that improve the reliability of ML-enabled robotic systems, particularly when these systems encounter out-of-distribution conditions with respect to their training data. Broadly, his research interests lie at the intersection of control theory, machine learning, and applied robotics. 

Previously, he received bachelor's degrees in Mechanical Engineering and Computer Science from the University of California, Berkeley. As an undergraduate, Rohan worked on data-driven predictive control under Prof. Francesco Borrelli in the Model Predictive Control Lab and on learning control algorithms that rely on vision systems under Prof. Benjamin Recht in the Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Lab. He has also interned as an autonomous driving engineer at Delphi (now Motional) and as a software engineer at Amazon.

In his free time, Rohan enjoys playing a variety of sports including sailing, tennis, soccer, and snowboarding.
