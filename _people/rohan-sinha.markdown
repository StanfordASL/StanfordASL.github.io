Rohan is a graduate student in the department of Aeronautics and Astronautics. Rohan's research interests lie at the intersection of control theory, machine learning, and applied robotics. Currently, his research focuses on developing learning-based control algorithms with safety guarantees.

Previously, he received bachelor's degrees in Mechanical Engineering and Computer Science from the University of California, Berkeley. As an undergraduate, Rohan worked on data-driven predictive control under Professor Francesco Borrelli in the Model Predictive Control Lab and on learning control algorithms that rely on vision systems under Professor Benjamin Recht in the Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Lab. He also interned as an autonomous driving engineer at Delphi (now Motional) and as a software engineer at Amazon.

In his free time, Rohan enjoys playing a variety of sports including sailing, tennis, soccer, and snowboarding.
