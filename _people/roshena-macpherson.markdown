Roshena MacPherson is a graduate student in Mechanical Engineering. She received her B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from the University of California, Berkeley in 2015. At the Center for Interdisciplinary Biological Inspiration in Education and Research (CiBER) at UC Berkeley, she worked on understanding the role of flexible tails in the fast turning capabilities of lizards. She is currently a Gabilan Fellow and an NSF Fellow.

Roshenaâ€™s research interests include control theory, mechatronics, robotics, and analysis of systems with complex and interesting dynamics. Her current research explores the use of gecko-inspired controllable dry adhesives for grasping and manipulation in space. She has been involved in the characterization of the grasping envelopes of compliant wrists equipped with gecko inspired adhesives, as well as the design of a controller to guarantee successful grasping of a spinning object. She plans to extend this research to develop a full control architecture to enable dynamic grasping in space.

In her spare time Roshena enjoys playing ultimate frisbee, rock climbing, yoga, drawing, playing music, and escaping to the mountains.
