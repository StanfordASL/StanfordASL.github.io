Welcome to Principles of Robot Autonomy I!

A few things to note before we head into the first week:
* Sections and Office Hours will start the week of September 30th.
* Section time sign-ups will go out next week, time to be determined (and announced, so you don't have to constantly refresh the page).
* If you cannot enroll in the Friday discussion section on Axess, don't worry about it. It is not essential that you enroll in the Friday section on Axess. However, it is essential that you know that Friday lectures will happen, and if you are enrolled in a 200+ course code variant of Principles of Robot Autonomy I, the homework will involve material from the Friday lectures. This will be stated again on Tuesday by Prof. Pavone.

If you are having difficulty accessing the course's gradescope page via the link in the Syllabus, try the following:
1. Open up <a href="https://www.gradescope.com/">gradescope</a>.
2. Click on the "Enroll in Course" button on the bottom right.
3. Enter the course code: 9YB864

See you next week!
