NOTE: This assignment is only for those enrolled in 4 units of Principles of Robot Autonomy I, irrespective of if you're an undergraduate or graduate student.

The paper we ask you to review is: [Past, Present, and Future of Simultaneous Localization And Mapping: Towards the Robust-Perception Age](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.05830.pdf)

For this review, we ask that you write (typeset) a 0.5 to 1-page summary of the paper. Summarize its important points and highlight areas that relate to and extend the course material. 

Take this chance to learn about state-of-the-art SLAM systems, especially if you have any interest in the further pursuit of robotics!
