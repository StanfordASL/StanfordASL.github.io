As we progress into Homework 2, it is time to start working with the TurtleBots! To do this, you must form into groups of *5 or 6* by adding your name/team 
<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XqVtdUDBXzeQyYXiddsOWzccT1WCfhCyTkoyhZa-B5o/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.

As a part of Homework 2 (and future homeworks), we will require at least one member from each team to come to the ROS Office Hours (Wed/Thurs from 5-7pm in Skilling) to demonstrate the ROS problem from the previous homework on an actual robot. With a successful demonstration, you and your team will get checked off.
