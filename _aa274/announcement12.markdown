The CMakeList.txt has been updated on the asl_turtlebot repo.

Please use the updated version for your homework. This resolves the “import asl_turtlebot.msg” error.
To avoid git issues, just copy and paste the CMakeList.txt in the <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StanfordASL/asl_turtlebot/master/CMakeLists.txt">raw format</a>.
