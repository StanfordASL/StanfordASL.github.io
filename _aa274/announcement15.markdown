We have just published Problem 0 for homework 3. This demo is very straight forward, and it is to show you how to get the entire robot “up and running”.
We have a few fully built robots ready for this and will be available for today’s ROS office hours. Drop by when you can. No need to sign up.

We apologise for the delay, as we ran into some issues building the robots, but we expect to have them all ready by next week.
