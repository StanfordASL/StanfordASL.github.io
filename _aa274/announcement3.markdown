The slides for the Python recitation today (Durand 450 1PM) are now posted <a href="/aa274/pdfs/recitation/python_review.pdf">here</a>. This is estimated to go for about 1 hour.

There are office hours today at 2-4PM in Durand 023. Since most of the theory for the homework will be covered next week, ROS/VM installation support will be available this OH.
