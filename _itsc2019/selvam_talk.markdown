Designing an efficient marketplace for ride sharing is a challenging task, since several independent systems need to respond in real time without getting in each otherâ€™s way. While the nature of supply in an autonomous world might be very different from what it is today, there are still several learnings and fundamental principles that are likely to be relevant in the future. This talk will describe how Lyft approaches marketplace design with respect to dynamic pricing, dispatch and driver positioning and how we plan for an autonomous future.
