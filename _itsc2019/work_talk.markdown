The majority of the best selling cars in the US are now available with Society of Automotive Engineers International level-one automated driving features such as adaptive cruise control. As the penetration rate of these vehicles grows on the roadways, it is now possible to consider controlling the bulk human-piloted traffic flow by carefully designing these automation systems. This talk will introduce modeling, simulation, and field experiments that illustrate the potential to control automated vehicles to stabilize traffic flow. Even when deployed at low penetration rates, it is possible to use automated vehicles to eliminate human-generated phantom traffic jams that seemingly occur without cause. The talk will also highlight new findings about the traffic impacts of current, commercially available level-one automated vehicle systems already on the road, providing insights on the future of traffic when humans and automation mix.
