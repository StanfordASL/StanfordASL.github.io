This work is motivated by the possibility of a small number of autonomous vehicles (AVs) or partially autonomous vehicles that may soon be present on our roadways, and the impacts they will have on traffic flow. This automation may take the form of fully autonomous vehicles without human intervention (SAE Level 5) or, as is already the case in many modern vehicles, may take the form of driver assist features such as adaptive cruise control (ACC) or other SAE Level 1 features. Regardless of the extent of automation, changing the vehicle dynamics of a small number of vehicles in the bulk traffic flow may have substantial implications on the underlying traffic dynamics and may influence traffic stability and the development of emergent phenomena such as phantom traffic jams.

In this talk, I present some recent experimental work conducted to understand how AVs may be able to influence traffic flow as well as a series of experiments to understand the car following behavior of commercially available ACC vehicles. The two-vehicle car following data is collected, and models are calibrated to describe the vehicle-level ACC car following behavior. These models are then analyzed for string stability. Of the seven vehicle models tested, all are found to be string unstable. To validate the models for multi-vehicle simulations, a platoon test with seven ACC following vehicles of the same make and model is also conducted, and stability analysis of the calibrated models is conducted.
