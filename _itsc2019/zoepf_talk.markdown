The traditional automotive industry is rapidly evolving into a personal mobility industry as shared access begins to replace private sales, electric vehicles begin to replace gasoline, and automation begins to replace human driving ability. As these trends begin to shape the industry, the way that we use vehicles is also evolving, and traditional benchmarks and measures of success no longer apply. In this talk we will discuss specific ways in which the mobility environment is changing and specific questions which automakers, suppliers and regulators should consider in the next decade.
