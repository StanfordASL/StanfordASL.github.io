Fully automated vehicles (also called autonomous vehicles) are not yet on the road, except for experimental batches. Despite this undeniable fact, a large amount of research has been already carried out on the topic. Visions where large shared automated vehicle fleets would be the backbone of transportation in urban areas is having a central role in the discussion about automated vehicles and future mobility. Several studies approached this kind of strategic planning questions with quantitative methodologies. However, we argue that some peculiarities of large shared automated vehicle systems were not taken into account. The paper shows how such peculiarities imply specific modeling/scenario requirements and how such requirements could be addressed. The argumentation is qualitative, but two examples based on empirical data are provided to support it. Concepts to address such requirements are described basing on MATSim, an agent-based simulation of transport which emerged in recent years as one of the most commonly used modeling frameworks for the assessment of shared vehicle systems.
