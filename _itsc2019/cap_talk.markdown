Self-driving technology will enable realization of large-scale mobility-on-demand systems. These systems hold promise to significantly improve the efficiency of urban transportation through massive car sharing and ride sharing. We develop computational models that can be used to quantify the potential of car sharing and ride sharing in urban on-demand mobility. In particular, we will present a method that can compute system parameters that achieve Pareto-optimal trade-offs between the quality of service, fleet size, and operation cost in a particular mobility-on-demand system.
