Shared autonomous vehicle (SAVs) are predicted to be a major usage model for automated vehicles. By providing driverless point-to-point service, SAV ridership costs could be similar to personal vehicle ownership. Consequently, recent studies have performed extensive simulations to investigate the effects on travel service, fleet size, and congestion. Unfortunately, a major limitation is in the dispatch strategy for matching vehicles to passengers. Vehicle routing problems are NP-hard, and the SAV problem is complicated by uncertainty in future demand. Consequently, studies have relied on heuristics but their level of optimality is unknown, which limits the generality of the simulation results. This paper investigates an analytical max-pressure policy which aims to maximize passenger throughput under stochastic demand. Although we make no claims about the optimality of waiting times, this policy is proven to maintain bounded queues of waiting passengers if at all possible. The stability region results can be used to determine the minimum fleet size needed for given average demand.
