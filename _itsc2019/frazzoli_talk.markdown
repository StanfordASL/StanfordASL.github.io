In past years, many of the most urgent questions related to autonomous mobility-on-demand were purely technical and vehicle centered: how safe are these vehicles, how comfortable are they, what scenarios can they handle? As public deployments worldwide are becoming more common, capabilities and limitations are becoming clearer.  On the other hand, much less confirmed knowledge is available on the operation and impact of large-scale autonomous mobility-on-demand systems with thousands of vehicles. What are the key parameters and constraints on operation? How many seats should the robotic taxis have? What will the influence on congestion be? Answering these questions is an exercise that requires not only technical know-how but also the consideration of societal and economic aspects. While much is still in the dark, research of most recent years has answered some of the open questions. This talk will provide insights into these answers of what we already know about autonomous mobility-on-demand. Moreover, it will also highlight some of the aspects which until today remain unanswered.
