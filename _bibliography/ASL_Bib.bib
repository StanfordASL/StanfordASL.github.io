However, the outputs of such algorithms are notoriously jagged. In this paper, by focusing on robots with car-like dynamics, we present a fast and simple heuristic algorithm, named Convex Elastic Smoothing (CES) algorithm, for trajectory smoothing and speed optimization. The CES algorithm is inspired by earlier work on elastic band planning and iteratively performs shape and speed optimization. The key feature of the algorithm is that both optimization problems can be solved via convex programming, making CES particularly fast. A range of numerical experiments show that the CES algorithm returns high-quality solutions in a matter of a few hundreds of milliseconds and hence appears amenable to a real-time implementation.},

The guarantee is in the form of invariant tubes, computed offline, around any nominal trajectories in which the actual states and inputs of the system are guaranteed to stay despite disturbances. Under mild assumptions, we prove that the proposed robust CCM (RCCM) approach yields tighter tubes than an existing approach based on CCM and input-to-state stability analysis. We show how the RCCM-based tracking controller together with tubes can be incorporated into a feedback motion planning framework to plan safe-guaranteed trajectories for robotic systems. Simulation results for a planar quadrotor illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and also empirically demonstrate significantly reduced conservatism compared to the CCM-based approach.},

We address AMoD systems along three dimensions: (1) modeling - analytical models capable of capturing the salient dynamic and stochastic features of customer demand, (2) control - coordination algorithms for the vehicles aimed at stability and subsequently throughput maximization, and (3) economic - fleet sizing and financial analyses for case studies of New York City and Singapore. Collectively, the models and algorithms presented in this paper enable a rigorous assessment of the value of AMoD systems. In particular, the case study of New York City shows that the current taxi demand in Manhattan can be met with about 8,000 robotic vehicles (roughly 70\% of the size of the current taxi fleet), while the case study of Singapore suggests that an AMoD system can meet the personal mobility need of the entire population of Singapore with a number of robotic vehicles that is less than 40\% of the current number of passenger vehicles. Directions for future research on AMoD systems are presented and discussed.},

We model the problem within a network flow framework and show that under relatively mild assumptions the rebalancing vehicles, if properly coordinated, do not lead to an increase in congestion (in stark contrast to common belief). From an algorithmic standpoint, such theoretical insight suggests that the problem of routing customers and rebalancing vehicles can be decoupled, which leads to a computationally-efficient routing and rebalancing algorithm for the autonomous vehicles. Numerical experiments and case studies corroborate our theoretical insights and show that the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art point-to-point methods by avoiding excess congestion on the road. Collectively, this paper provides a rigorous approach to the problem of congestion-aware, system-wide coordination of autonomously driving vehicles, and to the characterization of the sustainability of such robotic systems.},

Specifically, we first propose a novel discrete-time model of an AMoD system and we show that this formulation allows the easy integration of a number of real-world constraints, e.g., electric vehicle charging constraints. Second, leveraging our model, we design a model predictive control algorithm for the optimal coordination of an AMoD system and prove its stability in the sense of Lyapunov. At each optimization step, the vehicle scheduling and routing problem is solved as a mixed integer linear program (MILP) where the decision variables are binary variables representing whether a vehicle will 1) wait at a station, 2) service a customer, or 3) rebalance to another station. Finally, by using real-world data, we show that the MPC algorithm can be run in real-time for moderately-sized systems and outperforms previous control strategies for AMoD systems.},

  abstract = {Urban mobility in the 21st century faces significant challenges, as the unsustainable trends of urban population growth, congestion, pollution, and low vehicle utilization worsen in large cities around the world. As autonomous vehicle technology draws closer to realization, a solution is beginning to emerge in the form of autonomous mobility-on-demand (AMoD), whereby fleets of self-driving vehicles transport customers within an urban environment. This dissertation introduces a systematic approach to the design, control, and evaluation of these systems. In the first part of the dissertation, a stochastic queueing-theoretical model of AMoD is developed, which allows both the analysis of quality-of-service metrics as well as the synthesis of control policies. This model is then extended to one-way car sharing systems, or human-driven mobility-on-demand (MoD) systems. Based on these models, closed-loop control algorithms are designed to efficiently route empty (rebalancing) vehicles in very large systems with thousands of vehicles. The performance of the algorithms and the potential societal benefits of AMoD and MoD are evaluated through case studies of New York City and Singapore using real-world data. In the second part of the dissertation, additional structural and operational constraints are considered for AMoD systems. First, the impact of AMoD on traffic congestion with respect to the underlying structural properties of the road network is analyzed using a network flow model. In particular, it is shown that empty rebalancing vehicles in AMoD systems will not increase congestion, in stark contrast to popular belief. Finally, the control of AMoD systems with additional operational constraints is studied under a model predictive control framework, with a focus on range and charging constraints of electric vehicles. The technical approach developed in this dissertation allows us to evaluate the societal benefits of AMoD systems as well as lays the foundation for the design and control of future urban transportation networks.},

Our results show that servicing transportation demands jointly with public transit can significantly improve the service quality of AMoD systems. Additionally, we highlight the differences of our time-variant framework compared to existing mesoscopic, time-invariant models.},

  abstract = {Satellite servicing is a rapidly developing industry which requires a number advances in semi- and fully-automated space robotics to unlock many key servicing capabilities. One upcoming mission example is the NASA Restore-L Robotic Servicing spacecraft, which is equipped with two 7-joint robotic manipulators used to capture a satellite and perform a complex series of refueling tasks, including swapping between various end-effector tools stored on board. In this scenario, planning of the manipulator motions must account for a number of constraints, such as collision avoidance and the potential need for uninterrupted visual tracking of objects or of the end-effector. Such complex constraints in a cluttered environment, such as the interface between two spacecraft, are time-consuming to incorporate into hand-designed trajectories. Thus, in this work we present a software tool which uses robot motion planning and path refinement algorithms for automated, real-time computation of near-optimal, collision-free trajectories which satisfy the aforementioned perception constraints. The tool is built on the ROS MoveIt! framework, which can simulate and visualize trajectories as well as seamlessly switch between motion planning and refinement algorithms depending on task requirements. Additionally, we performed experimental campaigns to benchmark a number of available algorithms for performance in handling such perception constraints. Although the framework is applied to a mock-up of Restore-L satellite servicer in this paper, the tool can be applied to any fixed-base manipulator planning scenario with a similar class of constraints.},

  abstract    = {Automated vehicles (AVs) are expected to be beneficial for Mobility-on-Demand (MoD), thanks to their ability of being globally coordinated. To facilitate the steady transition towards full autonomy, we consider the transition period of AV deployment, whereby an MoD system operates a mixed fleet of automated vehicles (AVs) and human-driven vehicles (HVs). In such systems, AVs are centrally coordinated by the operator, and the HVs might strategically respond to the coordination of AVs. We devise computationally tractable strategies to coordinate mixed fleets in MoD systems. Specifically, we model an MoD system with a mixed fleet using a Stackelberg framework where the MoD operator serves as the leader and human-driven vehicles serve as the followers. We develop two models: 1) a steady-state model to analyze the properties of the problem and determine the planning variables (e.g., compensations, prices, and the fleet size of AVs), and 2) a time-varying model to design a real-time coordination algorithm for AVs. The proposed models are validated using a case study inspired by real operational data of a MoD service in Singapore. Results show that the proposed algorithms can significantly improve system performance.},

  abstract = {Robust motion planning entails computing a global motion plan that is safe under all possible uncertainty realizations, be it in the system dynamics, the robot's initial position, or with respect to external disturbances. Current approaches for robust motion planning either lack theoretical guarantees, or make restrictive assumptions on the system dynamics and uncertainty distributions. In this paper, we address these limitations by proposing the robust rapidly-exploring random-tree (Robust-RRT) algorithm, which integrates forward reachability analysis directly into sampling-based control trajectory synthesis. We prove that Robust-RRT is probabilistically complete (PC) for nonlinear Lipschitz continuous dynamical systems with bounded uncertainty. In other words, Robust-RRT eventually finds a robust motion plan that is feasible under all possible uncertainty realizations assuming such a plan exists. Our analysis applies even to unstable systems that admit only short-horizon feasible plans; this is because we explicitly consider the time evolution of reachable sets along control trajectories. Thanks to the explicit consideration of time dependency in our analysis, PC applies to unstabilizable systems. To the best of our knowledge, this is the most general PC proof for robust sampling-based motion planning, in terms of the types of uncertainties and dynamical systems it can handle. Considering that an exact computation of reachable sets can be computationally expensive for some dynamical systems, we incorporate sampling-based reachability analysis into Robust-RRT and demonstrate our robust planner on nonlinear, underactuated, and hybrid systems.},

This stands in stark contrast to modern machine learning systems that are typically designed with a known set of classes and a large number of examples for each class. In this work we extend embedding-based few-shot learning algorithms to the open-world recognition setting. We combine Bayesian non-parametric class priors with an embedding-based pre-training scheme to yield a highly flexible framework which we refer to as few-shot learning for open world recognition (FLOWR). We benchmark our framework on open-world extensions of the common MiniImageNet and TieredImageNet few-shot learning datasets. Our results show, compared to prior methods, strong classification accuracy performance and up to a 12\% improvement in H-measure (a measure of novel class detection) from our non-parametric open-world few-shot learning scheme.},

We rigorously analyze the controllability of the object, design a distributed compensation scheme to address these challenges, and show that the resulting strategy collectively guarantees full group control authority. To ensure feasibility for online implementation, we derive bounds on the net desired control wrench, characterize the output wrench space of each quadrotor, and perform subsequent trajectory optimization under these input constraints.

As such, there is often a diffusion of responsibilities when it comes to ensuring safety for the robot. We propose that a planner and controller should share the same interpretation of safety but apply this knowledge in a different yet complementary way. To achieve this, we use Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability theory at the planning level to provide the robot planner with the foresight to avoid entering regions with possible inevitable collision. However, this alone does not guarantee safety. In conjunction with this HJ reachability-infused planner, we propose a minimally-interventional multi-agent safety-preserving controller also derived via HJ-reachability theory. The safety controller maintains safety for the robot without unduly impacting planner performance. We demonstrate the benefits of our proposed approach in a multi-agent highway scenario where a robot car is rewarded to navigate through traffic as fast as possible, and we show that our approach provides strong safety assurances yet achieves the highest performance compared to other safety controllers.},

  abstract = {Locational marginal emissions rates (LMEs) estimate the rate of change in emissions due to a small change in demand in a transmission network, and are an important metric for assessing the impact of various energy policies or interventions. In this work, we develop a new method for computing the LMEs of an electricity system via implicit differentiation. The method is model agnostic; it can compute LMEs for almost any convex optimization-based dispatch model, including some of the complex dispatch models employed by system operators in real electricity systems. In particular, this method lets us derive LMEs for dynamic dispatch models, i.e., models with temporal constraints such as ramping and storage. Using real data from the U.S. electricity system, we validate the proposed method by comparing emissions predictions with another state-of-the-art method. We show that incorporating dynamic constraints improves prediction by 8.2%.  Finally, we use simulations on a realistic 240-bus model of WECC to demonstrate the flexibility of the tool and the importance of incorporating dynamic constraints. Namely, static LMEs and dynamic LMEs exhibit an average RMS deviation of 28.40%, implying dynamic constraints are essential to accurately modeling emissions rates.},

  abstract = {The era of Big Data has brought with it a richer understanding of user behavior through massive data sets, which can help organizations optimize the quality of their services. In the context of transportation research, mobility data can provide Municipal Authorities (MA) with insights on how to operate, regulate, or improve the transportation network. Mobility data, however, may contain sensitive information about end users and trade secrets of Mobility Providers (MP). Due to this data privacy concern, MPs may be reluctant to contribute their datasets to MA. Using ideas from cryptography, we propose an interactive protocol between a MA and a MP in which MA obtains insights from mobility data without MP having to reveal its trade secrets or sensitive data of its users. This is accomplished in two steps: a commitment step, and a computation step. In the first step, Merkle commitments and aggregated traffic measurements are used to generate a cryptographic commitment. In the second step, MP extracts insights from the data and sends them to MA. Using the commitment and zero-knowledge proofs, MA can certify that the information received from MP is accurate, without needing to directly inspect the mobility data. We also present a differentially private version of the protocol that is suitable for the large query regime. The protocol is verifiable for both MA and MP in the sense that dishonesty from one party can be detected by the other. The protocol can be readily extended to the more general setting with multiple MPs via secure multi-party computation.},

  year         = {2022},
  abstract = {Data-driven methodologies offer many exciting upsides, but they also introduce new challenges, particularly in the realm of user privacy. Specifically, the way data is collected can pose privacy risks to end users. In many routing services, a single entity (e.g., the routing service provider) collects and manages user trajectory data. When it comes to user privacy, these systems have a central point of failure since users have to trust that this entity will not sell or use their data to infer sensitive private information. With this as motivation, we study the problem of using location data for routing services in a privacy-preserving way. Rather than having users report their location to a central operator, we present a protocol in which users participate in a decentralized and privacy-preserving computation to estimate travel times for the roads in the network in a way that no individuals' location is ever observed by any other party. The protocol uses the Laplace mechanism in conjunction with secure multi-party computation to ensure that it is cryptogrpahically secure and that its output is differentially private. The protocol is computationally efficient and does not require specialized hardware; all it needs is GPS, which is included in most mobile devices. A natural question is if privacy necessitates degradation in accuracy or system performance. We show that if a road has sufficiently high capacity, then the travel time estimated by our protocol is provably close to the ground truth travel time. We validate the protocol through numerical experiments which show that using the protocol as a routing service provides privacy guarantees with minimal overhead to user travel time.},

  abstract = {We study fundamental theoretical aspects of probabilistic roadmaps (PRM) in the finite time (non-asymptotic) regime. In particular, we investigate how completeness and optimality guarantees of the approach are influenced by the underlying deterministic sampling distribution $\mathcal{X}$ and connection radius $r>0$. We develop the notion of $(\delta,\epsilon)$-completeness of the parameters $\mathcal{X},r$, which indicates that for every motion-planning problem of clearance at least $\delta>0$, PRM using $\mathcal{X},r$ returns a solution no longer than $1+\epsilon$ times the shortest $\delta$-clear path. Leveraging the concept of $\epsilon$-nets, we characterize in terms of lower and upper bounds the number of samples needed to guarantee $(\delta,\epsilon)$-completeness. This is in contrast with previous work which mostly considered the asymptotic regime in which the number of samples tends to infinity. In practice, we propose a sampling distribution inspired by $\epsilon$-nets that achieves nearly the same coverage as grids while using significantly fewer samples.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a model predictive control (MPC) approach to optimize routes for Ride-sharing Autonomous Mobility-on-Demand (RAMoD) systems, whereby self-driving vehicles provide coordinated on-demand mobility, possibly allowing multiple customers to share a ride. Specifically, we first devise a time-expanded network flow model for RAMoD. Second, leveraging this model, we design a real-time MPC algorithm to optimize the routes of both empty and customer-carrying vehicles, with the goal of optimizing social welfare, namely, a weighted combination of customers' travel time and vehicles' mileage. Finally, we present a real-world case study for the city of San Francisco, CA, by using the microscopic traffic simulator MATSim. The simulation results show that a RAMoD system can significantly improve social welfare with respect to a single-occupancy AMoD system, and that the predictive structure of the proposed MPC controller allows it to outperform existing reactive ride-sharing coordination algorithms for RAMoD.},

If left unaddressed, potential privacy risks may deter users from contributing their data to cyber-physical systems, thereby limiting the effectiveness of data-driven tools employed by the systems. To ensure that users are protected from privacy risks and feel comfortable sharing their data with cyber-physical systems, this chapter discusses how differential privacy and cryptography, techniques originally developed for privacy in health care and computer systems respectively, can be used to conduct data analysis and optimization with principled privacy guarantees in cyber-physical systems. Along the way, we will discuss and compare the properties, strengths weaknesses of these approaches. We will also show why these techniques address many of the privacy-related issues that arise when using data anonymization and data aggregation, two of the most common approaches to privacy-aware data sharing.},

  note         = {Submitted},
  abstract = {Network routing problems are common across many engineering applications. Computing optimal routing policies requires knowledge about network demand, i.e., the origin and destination (OD) of all requests in the network. However, privacy considerations make it challenging to share individual OD data that would be required for computing optimal policies. Privacy can be particularly challenging in standard network routing problems because sources and sinks can be easily identified from flow conservation constraints, making feasibility and privacy mutually exclusive. In this paper, we present a differentially private algorithm for network routing problems. The main ingredient is a reformulation of network routing which moves all user data-dependent parameters out of the constraint set and into the objective function. We then present an algorithm for solving this formulation based on a differentially private variant of stochastic gradient descent. In this algorithm, differential privacy is achieved by injecting noise, and one may wonder if this noise injection compromises solution quality. We prove that our algorithm is both differentially private and asymptotically optimal as the size of the training set goes to infinity. We corroborate the theoretical results with numerical experiments on a road traffic network which show that our algorithm provides differentially private and near-optimal solutions in practice.},

While vastly many SCPs encountered in practice are embedded in road or road-like networks, very few studies explicitly consider such environments. In this paper, first, we formulate an environment model capturing the essential features of a "small-neighborhood" road network, along with models for omni-directional vehicles and directed vehicles. Then, we formulate a stochastic version of the unit-capacity SCP, on our road network model, where pickup/delivery sites are random points along segments of the network. Our main contribution is a polynomial-time algorithm for the problem that is asymptotically constant-factor; i.e., it produces a solution no worse than $\kappa+o(1)$ times the length of the optimal one, where $o(1)$ goes to zero as the number of items grows large, almost surely. The constant $\kappa$ is at most 3, and for omni-directional vehicles it is provably 1, i.e., optimal. Simulations show that with a number of pickup/delivery pairs as low as 50, the proposed algorithm delivers a solution whose cost is consistently within 10\% of that of an optimal solution.},

  abstract = {Demand-responsive transport (DRT) systems, where users generate requests for transportation from a pickup point to a delivery point, are expected to increase in usage dramatically as the inconvenience of privately-owned cars in metropolitan areas becomes excessive. However, despite the increasing role of DRT systems, there are very few rigorous results characterizing achievable performance (in terms, e.g., of stability conditions). In this paper, our aim is to bridge this gap for a rather general model of DRT systems, which takes the form of a generalized Dynamic Pickup and Delivery Problem. The key strategy is to develop analytical bounds for the optimal cost of the Euclidean Stacker Crane Problem (ESCP), which represents a general static model for DRT systems. By leveraging such bounds, we characterize a necessary and sufficient condition for the stability of DRT systems; the condition depends only on the workspace geometry, the stochastic distributions of pickup and delivery points, customers' arrival rate, and the number of vehicles. Our results exhibit some surprising features that are absent in traditional spatially-distributed queueing systems.},

  abstract = {Pickup and delivery problems (PDPs), in which objects or people have to be transported between specific locations, are among the most common combinatorial problems in real-world logistical operations. A widely-encountered type of PDP is the Stacker Crane Problem (SCP), where each commodity/customer is associated with a pickup location and a delivery location, and the objective is to find a minimum-length tour visiting all locations with the constraint that each pickup location and its associated delivery location are visited in immediate, consecutive order. The SCP is NP-Hard and the best known approximation algorithm only provides a 9/5 approximation ratio. In this paper, we examine an embedding of the SCP within a stochastic framework, and our objective is three-fold: First, we describe a large class of algorithms for the SCP, where every member is asymptotically optimal, i.e., it produces, almost surely, a solution approaching the optimal one as the number of pickups/deliveries goes to infinity; moreover, one can achieve computational complexity $O(n^2+\epsilon)$ within the class, where n is the number of pickup/delivery pairs and $\epsilon$ is an arbitrarily small positive constant. Second, we characterize the length of the optimal SCP tour asymptotically. Finally, we study a dynamic version of the SCP, whereby pickup and delivery requests arrive according to a Poisson process, and which serves as a model for large-scale demand-responsive transport (DRT) systems. For such a dynamic counterpart of the SCP, we derive a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of stable vehicle routing policies, which depends only on the workspace geometry, the distributions of pickup and delivery points, the arrival rate of requests, and the number of vehicles. Our results leverage a novel connection between the Euclidean Bipartite Matching Problem and the theory of random permutations, and, for the dynamic setting, exhibit novel features that are absent in traditional spatially-distributed queueing systems.},

These high-fidelity models are therefore ideal for designing controllers for complex dynamic tasks such as trajectory optimization and trajectory tracking. However, finite element models are also typically very high-dimensional, which makes real-time control challenging. In this work we propose an approach for finite element model-based control of soft robots that leverages model order reduction techniques to significantly increase computational efficiency. In particular, a constrained optimal control problem is formulated based on a nonlinear reduced order finite element model and is solved via sequential convex programming. This approach is demonstrated through simulation of a cable-driven soft robot for a constrained trajectory tracking task, where a 9768-dimensional finite element model is used for controller design.},

In this paper we present a novel, low cost high-altitude balloon system that achieves multi-day flight using inexpensive latex balloons by automatically venting lifting gas and dispensing ballast to maintain altitude. Traditionally, superpressure balloons have been used for high-altitude scientific missions; however, despite their long endurance and payload capacity in the tens of kilograms, their cost is in excess of tens of thousands of dollars. Latex balloons are significantly less expensive, typically costing little more than a hundred dollars, but in normal use fly for only a couple hours, rising until reduced atmospheric pressure causes the balloon to stretch beyond its limits. Precision-weighted latex balloons have demonstrated multi-day flights, but such systems cannot change altitude while aloft and offer minimal payload capacity (measuring in tens of grams). Our system, known as ValBal, offers altitude control capabilities exceeding those of a superpressure balloon at a two order of magnitude reduction in cost. ValBal can stabilize anywhere in its operational range of 10-25 km altitude, and can execute scheduled or remotely commanded altitude transitions during flight. In its current iteration, ValBal can be configured to accommodate payloads on the order of 10000 cubic centimeters and 2 kilograms. In June 2016, a ValBal demonstration mission flew for over 70 hours continuously, surpassing the previous world record of 57 hours, for the longest duration of a latex balloon flight. ValBal has flown twice more since then, including a flight of almost 80 hours. Planned developments will seek to improve the endurance to a week and increase the payload interface capabilities for scientific missions.},

Stealth operations rule out voice commands and vision-based gesture interpretation techniques, as they often entail silent operations at night or in other low visibility conditions. Targeted at using bio-signal inputs to set navigation and manipulation goals for the robot (say, simply by pointing), we developed a system based on an electromyography (EMG) "BioSleeve", a high density sensor array for robust, practical signal collection from forearm muscles. The EMG sensor array data is fused with inertial measurement unit (IMU) data. This paper describes the BioSleeve system and presents initial results of decoding robot commands from the EMG and IMU data using a BioSleeve prototype with up to sixteen bipolar surface EMG sensors. The BioSleeve is demonstrated on the recognition of static hand positions (e.g. palm facing front, fingers upwards) and on dynamic gestures (e.g. hand wave). In preliminary experiments, over 90\% correct recognition was achieved on five static and nine dynamic gestures. We use the BioSleeve to control a team of five LANdroid robots in individual and group/squad behaviors. We define a gesture composition mechanism that allows the specification of complex robot behaviors with only a small vocabulary of gestures/commands, and we illustrate it with a set of complex orders.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a sampling-based motion planning algorithm for real-time and propellant-optimized autonomous spacecraft trajectory generation in near-circular orbits. Specifically, this paper leverages recent algorithmic advances in the field of robot motion planning to the problem of impulsively-actuated, propellant-optimized rendezvous and proximity operations under the Clohessy-Wiltshire-Hill (CWH) dynamics model. The approach calls upon a modified version of the Fast Marching Tree (FMT*) algorithm to grow a set of feasible trajectories over a deterministic, low-dispersion set of sample points covering the free state space. To enforce safety, the tree is only grown over the subset of actively-safe samples, from which there exists a feasible one-burn collision avoidance maneuver that can safely circularize the spacecraft orbit along its coasting arc under a given set of potential thruster failures. Key features of the proposed algorithm include: (i) theoretical guarantees in terms of trajectory safety and performance, (ii) amenability to real-time implementation, and (iii) generality, in the sense that a large class of constraints can be handled directly. As a result, the proposed algorithm offers the potential for widespread application, ranging from on-orbit satellite servicing to orbital debris removal and autonomous inspection missions.},

  abstract = {Bi-directional search is a widely used strategy to increase the success and convergence rates of sampling-based motion planning algorithms. Yet, few results are available that merge both bi-directional search and asymptotic optimality into existing optimal planners, such as PRM*, RRT*, and FMT*. The objective of this paper is to fill this gap. Specifically, this paper presents a bi-directional, sampling-based, asymptotically-optimal algorithm named Bi-directional FMT* (BFMT*) that extends the Fast Marching Tree (FMT*) algorithm to bidirectional search while preserving its key properties, chiefly lazy search and asymptotic optimality through convergence in probability. BFMT* performs a two-source, lazy dynamic programming recursion over a set of randomly-drawn samples, correspondingly generating two search trees: one in cost-to-come space from the initial configuration and another in cost-to-go space from the goal configuration. Numerical experiments illustrate the advantages of BFMT* over its unidirectional counterpart, as well as a number of other state-of-the-art planners.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a method for safe spacecraft autonomous maneuvering that leverages robotic motion planning techniques to spacecraft control. Specifically, the scenario we consider is an in-plane rendezvous of a chaser spacecraft in proximity to a target spacecraft at the origin of the Clohessy-Wiltshire-Hill frame. The trajectory for the chaser spacecraft is generated in a receding-horizon fashion by executing a sampling-based robotic motion planning algorithm named Fast Marching Trees (FMT*), which efficiently grows a tree of trajectories over a set of probabilistically-drawn samples in the state space. To enforce safety, the tree is only grown over actively safe samples, from which there exists a one-burn collision avoidance maneuver that circularizes the spacecraft orbit along a collision-free coasting arc and that can be executed under potential thruster failures. The overall approach establishes a provably-correct framework for the systematic encoding of safety specifications into the spacecraft trajectory generation process and appears promising for real-time implementation on orbit. Simulation results are presented for a two-fault tolerant spacecraft during autonomous approach to a single client in Low Earth Orbit.},

This chapter, building upon this framework, aims at providing such technical details for a selected number of high-priority technologies in the autonomous systems area. Specifically, this chapter focuses on technology area TA04 ``Robotics, Tele-Robotics, and Autonomous Systems" and discusses in some detail the technical aspects and challenges associated with three high-priority TA04 technologies: ``Relative Guidance Algorithms," ``Extreme Terrain Mobility," and ``Small Body/Microgravity Mobility." Each of these technologies is discussed along four main dimensions: scope, need, state-of-the-art, and challenges/future directions. The result is a unified presentation of key autonomy challenges for next-generation space missions.},

  abstract = {Autonomy has demonstrated success in many vehicle control problems, but has yet to show significant breakthroughs for spacecraft guidance during proximity operations. In part due to a costly verification and validation process as well as from limited access to formally-safe guidance algorithms, mission planners have instead had to rely on maneuver plans with straightforward, easily-verified trajectories and extensive human oversight. Unfortunately, this strategy often introduces propellant inefficiencies, adds significant labor overhead, and limits missions to Earth proximity where two-way communication times are short. This dissertation seeks to remedy these issues by developing a provably-safe and propellant-efficient sampling-based motion planning framework for fully-autonomous spacecraft proximity operations. The framework is designed for a wide range of hazardous guidance scenarios, including autonomous orbital rendezvous and inspection, pinpoint small-body descent, and on-orbit satellite servicing. Due to the dangers associated with operating near other objects, special care is taken to enable real-time guidance as well as ensure the availability of safe abort trajectories so that spacecraft can respond quickly and safely to control failures and sudden environmental changes. Through its generality, efficiency, and speed, the proposed approach offers the potential to enable entirely new capabilities for next-generation space missions, while also increasing the frequency, flexibility, and reliability of present-day operations in space.},

  abstract = {We consider the problem of vehicle routing for Autonomous Mobility-on-Demand (AMoD) systems, wherein a fleet of self-driving vehicles provides on-demand mobility in a given environment. Specifically, the task it to compute routes for the vehicles (both customer-carrying and empty travelling) so that travel demand is fulfilled and operational cost is minimized. The routing process must account for congestion effects affecting travel times, as modeled via a volume-delay function (VDF). Route planning with VDF constraints is notoriously challenging, as such constraints compound the combinatorial complexity of the routing optimization process. Thus, current solutions for AMoD routing resort to relaxations of the congestion constraints, thereby trading optimality with computational efficiency. In this paper, we present the first computationally-efficient approach for AMoD routing where VDF constraints are explicitly accounted for. We demonstrate that our approach is faster by at least one order of magnitude with respect to the state of the art, while providing higher quality solutions. From a methodological standpoint, the key technical insight is to establish a mathematical reduction of the AMoD routing problem to the classical traffic assignment problem (a related vehicle-routing problem where empty traveling vehicles are not present). Such a reduction allows us to extend powerful algorithmic tools for traffic assignment, which combine the classic Frank-Wolfe algorithm with modern techniques for pathfinding, to the AMoD routing problem. We provide strong theoretical guarantees for our approach in terms of near-optimality of the returned solution.},

This algorithm laid the foundations for optimality in motion planning as a whole, and inspired the development of numerous new algorithms in the field, many of which build upon RRT* itself. In this paper, we first identify a logical gap in the optimality proof of RRT*, which was developed in Karaman and Frazzoli (2011). Then, we present an alternative and mathematically-rigorous proof for asymptotic optimality. Our proof suggests that the connection radius used by RRT* should be increased from $\gamma (\frac{\log n}{n})^{1/d}$ to $\gamma' (\frac{\log n}{n})^{1/(d+1)}$ in order to account for the additional dimension of time that dictates the samples' ordering. Here $gamma, \gamma'$ are constants, and $n, d$ are the number of samples and the dimension of the problem, respectively.},

  abstract = {Multi-robot systems are uniquely well-suited to performing complex tasks such as patrolling and tracking, information gathering, and pick-up and delivery problems, offering significantly higher performance than single-robot systems. A fundamental building block in most multi-robot systems is task allocation: assigning robots to tasks (e.g., patrolling an area, or servicing a transportation request) as they appear based on the robots' states to maximize reward. In many practical situations, the allocation must account for heterogeneous capabilities (e.g., availability of appropriate sensors or actuators) to ensure the feasibility of execution, and to promote a higher reward, over a long time horizon. To this end, we present the FlowDec algorithm for efficient heterogeneous task-allocation achieving an approximation factor of at least 1/2 of the optimal reward. Our approach decomposes the heterogeneous problem into several homogeneous subproblems that can be solved efficiently using min-cost flow. Through simulation experiments, we show that our algorithm is faster by several orders of magnitude than a MILP approach.},

  booktitle    = proc_IEEE_ACC,
  year         = {2013},
  abstract = {In this paper we study rebalancing strategies for a mobility-on-demand urban transportation system blending customer-driven vehicles with a taxi service. In our system, a customer arrives at one of many designated stations and is transported to any other designated station, either by driving themselves, or by being driven by an employed driver. The system allows for one-way trips, so that customers do not have to return to their origin. When some origins and destinations are more popular than others, vehicles will become unbalanced, accumulating at some stations and becoming depleted at others. This problem is addressed by employing rebalancing drivers to drive vehicles from the popular destinations to the unpopular destinations. However, with this approach the rebalancing drivers themselves become unbalanced, and we need to "rebalance the rebalancers" by letting them travel back to the popular destinations with a customer. Accordingly, in this paper we study how to optimally route the rebalancing vehicles and drivers so that stability (in terms of boundedness of the number of waiting customers) is ensured while minimizing the number of rebalancing vehicles traveling in the network and the number of rebalancing drivers needed; surprisingly, these two objectives are aligned, and one can find the optimal rebalancing strategy by solving two decoupled linear programs. Leveraging our analysis, we determine the minimum number of drivers and minimum number of vehicles needed to ensure stability in the system. Interestingly, our simulations suggest that, in Euclidean network topologies, one would need between 1/3 and 1/4 as many drivers as vehicles.},

To service a demand, one of the vehicles must travel to the demand location and remain there for the required on-site service time. The quality of service provided to each class is given by the expected delay between the arrival of a demand in the class and that demand's service completion. The goal is to design a routing policy for the service vehicles which minimizes a convex combination of the delays for each class. First, we provide a lower bound on the achievable values of the convex combination of delays. Then, we propose a novel routing policy and analyze its performance under heavy-load conditions (i.e., when the fraction of time the service vehicles spend performing on-site service approaches one). The policy performs within a constant factor of the lower bound, where the constant depends only on the number of classes, and is independent of the number of vehicles, the arrival rates of demands, the on-site service times, and the convex combination coefficients.},

The key idea is to develop a new control-theoretic regularizer for dynamics fitting rooted in the notion of stabilizability, which guarantees that the learnt system can be accompanied by a robust controller capable of stabilizing any trajectory that the system can generate. By leveraging tools from contraction theory, statistical learning, and convex optimization, we provide a general and tractable algorithm to learn stabilizable dynamics, which can be applied to complex underactuated systems. We validate the proposed algorithm on a simulated planar quadrotor system and observe that the control-theoretic regularized dynamics model is able to consistently generate and accurately track reference trajectories whereas the model learnt using standard regression techniques, e.g., ridge-regression (RR) does extremely poorly on both tasks. Furthermore, in aggressive flight regimes with high velocity and bank angle, the tracking controller fails to stabilize the trajectory generated by the ridge-regularized model whereas no instabilities were observed using the control-theoretic learned model, even with a small number of demonstration examples. The results presented illustrate the need to infuse standard model-based reinforcement learning algorithms with concepts drawn from nonlinear control theory for improved reliability.},

The key contribution is a control-theoretic regularizer for dynamics fitting rooted in the notion of stabilizability, a constraint which guarantees the existence of robust tracking controllers for arbitrary open-loop trajectories generated with the learned system. Leveraging tools from contraction theory and statistical learning in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, we formulate stabilizable dynamics learning as a functional optimization with a convex objective and bi-convex functional constraints. Under a mild structural assumption and relaxation of the functional constraints to sampling-based constraints, we derive the optimal solution with a modified representer theorem. Finally, we utilize random matrix feature approximations to reduce the dimensionality of the search parameters and formulate an iterative convex optimization algorithm that jointly fits the dynamics functions and searches for a certificate of stabilizability. We validate the proposed algorithm in simulation for a planar quadrotor, and on a quadrotor hardware testbed emulating planar dynamics. We verify, both in simulation and on hardware, significantly improved trajectory generation and tracking performance with the control-theoretic regularized model over models learned using traditional regression techniques, especially when learning from small supervised datasets. The results support the conjecture that the use of stabilizability constraints as a form of regularization can help prune the hypothesis space in a manner that is tailored to the downstream task of trajectory generation and feedback control. This produces models that are not only dramatically better conditioned, but also data efficient.},

  abstract = {We present a framework for online generation of robust motion plans for robotic systems with nonlinear dynamics subject to bounded disturbances, control constraints, and online state constraints such as obstacles. In an offline phase, one computes the structure of a feedback controller that can be efficiently implemented online to track any feasible nominal trajectory. The offline phase leverages contraction theory and convex optimization to characterize a fixed-size ``tube'' that the state is guaranteed to remain within while tracking a nominal trajectory (representing the center of the tube). In the online phase, when the robot is faced with obstacles, a motion planner uses such a tube as a robustness margin for collision checking, yielding nominal trajectories that can be safely executed (i.e., tracked without collisions under disturbances). In contrast to recent work on robust online planning using funnel libraries, our approach is not restricted to a fixed library of maneuvers computed offline and is thus particularly well-suited to applications such as UAV flight in densely cluttered environments where complex maneuvers may be required to reach a goal. We demonstrate our approach through simulations of a 6-state planar quadrotor navigating cluttered environments in the presence of a cross-wind. We also discuss applications of our approach to Tube Model Predictive Control (TMPC) and compare the merits of our method with state-of-the-art nonlinear TMPC techniques.},

  abstract = {The literature on Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) typically assumes that humans take actions in order to minimize the expected value of a cost function, i.e., that humans are risk neutral. Yet, in practice, humans are often far from being risk neutral. To fill this gap, the objective of this paper is to devise a framework for risk-sensitive IRL in order to explicitly account for a human's risk sensitivity. To this end, we propose a flexible class of models based on coherent risk measures, which allow us to capture an entire spectrum of risk preferences from risk-neutral to worst-case. We propose efficient non-parametric algorithms based on linear programming and semi-parametric algorithms based on maximum likelihood for inferring a human's underlying risk measure and cost function for a rich class of static and dynamic decision-making settings. The resulting approach is demonstrated on a simulated driving game with ten human participants. Our method is able to infer and mimic a wide range of qualitatively different driving styles from highly risk-averse to risk-neutral in a data-efficient manner. Moreover, comparisons of the Risk-Sensitive (RS) IRL approach with a risk-neutral model show that the RS-IRL framework more accurately captures observed participant behavior both qualitatively and quantitatively, especially in scenarios where catastrophic outcomes such as collisions can occur.},

  abstract = {A drag-free satellite is a spacecaft composed of an internal test mass shielded by an external satellite that compensates all dominant disturbance forces encountered in the space environment such as aerodynamic drag and solar radiation pressure. By minimizing all non-gravitational disturbances on the test mass, the trajectory of the spacecraft is a near perfect geodesic. In concert with precise orbit determination techniques, drag-free satellites allow us to investigate topics in geodesy, aeronomy, and gravitational physics and conduct challenging experiments in low-disturbance environments to unprecedented accuracy. This paper addresses the development of a high-fidelity simulator and control system design for the Modular Gravitational Reference Sensor (MGRS) drag-free satellite. MGRS is a 100 kg microsatellite due to launch in 2018 into a Sun-synchronous orbit with a mean altitude of 657 km that aims to demonstrate three-axis drag-free operations with residual non-gravitational acceleration of a test mass under $10^{-12} \msrootHz$ in the frequency range 0.01 to 1 Hz. The drag-free performance goal reflects a substantial improvement upon past drag-free missions such as TRIAD I, GPB, and GOCE, and will be accomplished at a fraction of the cost. Additionally, this mission represents a key technology demonstration within a larger research endeavour that aims to develop a multi-purpose distributed drag-free architecture based on microsatellite platforms. Our modeling framework allows us to gain a comprehensive insight into the range of expected disturbances, derive sizing constraints for a suitable micropropulsion system, and formulate a preliminary drag-free translational and attitude control system using $H_{\infty}-$ control techniques.},

  booktitle    = proc_WAFR,
  year         = {2018},
  abstract = {In the pursuit of real-time motion planning, a commonly adopted practice is to compute a trajectory by running a planning algorithm on a simplified, low-dimensional dynamical model, and then employ a feedback tracking controller that tracks such a trajectory by accounting for the full, high-dimensional system dynamics. While this strategy of planning with model mismatch generally yields fast computation times, there are no guarantees of dynamic feasibility, which hampers application to safety-critical systems. Building upon recent work that addressed this problem through the lens of Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability, we devise an algorithmic framework whereby one computes, offline, for a pair of "planner" (i.e., low-dimensional) and "tracking" (i.e., high-dimensional) models, a feedback tracking controller and associated tracking bound. This bound is then used as a safety margin when generating motion plans via the low-dimensional model. Specifically, we harness the computational tool of sum-of-squares (SOS) programming to design a bilinear optimization algorithm for the computation of the feedback tracking controller and associated tracking bound. The algorithm is demonstrated via numerical experiments, with an emphasis on investigating the trade-off between the increased computational scalability afforded by SOS and its intrinsic conservativeness. Collectively, our results enable scaling the appealing strategy of planning with model mismatch to systems that are beyond the reach of HJ analysis, while maintaining safety guarantees.},

  abstract = {Integrating autonomous robots into safety-critical settings requires reasoning about uncertainty at all levels of the autonomy stack. This thesis presents novel algorithmic tools for imbuing robustness within two hierarchically complementary areas, namely: motion planning and decision-making. In Part I of the thesis, by harnessing the theories of contraction and semi-infinite convex optimization and the computational tool of sum-of-squares programming, we present a unified framework for robust real-time motion planning for complex underactuated nonlinear systems. Broadly, the approach entails pairing open-loop motion planning algorithms that neglect uncertainty and are optimized for generating trajectories for simple kinodynamic models in real-time, with robust nonlinear trajectory-tracking feedback controllers. We demonstrate how to systematically synthesize these controllers and integrate them within planning to generate and execute certifiably safe trajectories that are robust to the closed-loop effects of disturbances and planning with simplified models. In Part II of the thesis, we demonstrate how to embed the control-theoretic advancements developed in Part I as constraints within a novel semi-supervised algorithm for learning dynamical systems from user demonstrations. The constraints act as a form of context-driven hypothesis pruning to yield learned models that jointly balance regression performance and stabilizability, ultimately resulting in generated trajectories for the robot that are conditioned for feedback control. Experimental results on a quadrotor testbed illustrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithms in Parts I and II of the thesis, and clear connections between theory and hardware. Finally, in Part III of the thesis, we describe a framework for lifting notions of robustness from lowlevel motion planning to higher-level sequential decision-making using the theory of risk measures. Leveraging a class of risk measures with favorable axiomatic foundations, we demonstrate how to formulate decision-making algorithms with tunable robustness properties. In particular, we focus on a novel application of this framework to inverse reinforcement learning where we learn predictive motion models for humans in safety-critical scenarios, and illustrate their effectiveness within a commercial driving simulator featuring humans in-the-loop. The contributions within this thesis constitute an important step towards endowing modern robotic systems with the ability to systematically and hierarchically reason about safety and efficiency in the face of uncertainty, which is crucial for safety-critical applications},

In this paper, we propose the Robust Adaptive Monte Carlo Planning (RAMCP) algorithm, which allows computation of risk-sensitive Bayes-adaptive policies that optimally trade off exploration, exploitation, and robustness. RAMCP formulates the risk-sensitive planning problem as a two-player zero-sum game, in which an adversary perturbs the agent's belief over the models. We introduce two versions of the RAMCP algorithm. The first, RAMCP-F, converges to an optimal risk-sensitive policy without having to rebuild the search tree as the underlying belief over models is perturbed. The second version, RAMCP-I, improves computational efficiency at the cost of losing theoretical guarantees, but is shown to yield empirical results comparable to RAMCP-F. RAMCP is demonstrated on an n-pull multi-armed bandit problem, as well as a patient treatment scenario.},

Building on recent work leveraging the local curvature of DNNs to reason about epistemic uncertainty, we propose Sketching Curvature of OoD Detection (SCOD), an architecture-agnostic framework for equipping any trained DNN with a task-relevant epistemic uncertainty estimate. Offline, given a trained model and its training data, SCOD employs tools from matrix sketching to tractably compute a low-rank approximation of the Fisher information matrix, which characterizes which directions in the weight space are most influential on the predictions over the training data. Online, we estimate uncertainty by measuring how much perturbations orthogonal to these directions can alter predictions at a new test input. We apply SCOD to pre-trained networks of varying architectures on several tasks, ranging from regression to classification. We demonstrate that SCOD achieves comparable or better OoD detection performance with lower computational burden relative to existing baselines.},

  abstract = {Robots are widely deployed in space environments because of their versatility and robustness. However, adverse gravity conditions and challenging terrain geometry expose the limitations of traditional robot designs, which are often forced to sacrifice one of mobility or manipulation capabilities to attain the other. Prospective climbing operations in these environments reveals a need for small, compact robots capable of versatile mobility and manipulation. We propose a novel robotic concept called ReachBot that fills this need by combining two existing technologies: extendable booms and mobile manipulation. ReachBot leverages the reach and tensile strength of extendable booms to achieve an outsized reachable workspace and wrench capability. Through their lightweight, compactable structure, these booms also reduce mass and complexity compared to traditional rigid-link articulated-arm designs. Using these advantages, ReachBot excels in mobile manipulation missions in low gravity or that require climbing, particularly when anchor points are sparse. After introducing the ReachBot concept, we discuss modeling approaches and strategies for increasing stability and robustness. We then develop a 2D analytical model for ReachBotâ€™s dynamics inspired by grasp models for dexterous manipulators. Next, we introduce a waypoint-tracking controller for a planar ReachBot in microgravity. Our simulation results demonstrate the controllerâ€™s robustness to disturbances and modeling error. Finally, we briefly discuss next steps that build on these initially promising results to realize the full potential of ReachBot.},

Our approach is to learn multimodal probability distributions over future human actions from a dataset of human-human exemplars and perform real-time robot policy construction in the resulting environment model through massively parallel sampling of human responses to candidate robot action sequences. Direct learning of these distributions is made possible by recent advances in the theory of conditional variational autoencoders (CVAEs), whereby we learn action distributions simultaneously conditioned on the present interaction history, as well as candidate future robot actions in order to take into account response dynamics. We demonstrate the efficacy of this approach with a human-in-the-loop simulation of a traffic weaving scenario.},

In this paper we provide a thorough theoretical framework to assess optimality guarantees of sampling-based algorithms for planning under differential constraints. We exploit this framework to design and analyze two novel sampling-based algorithms that are guaranteed to converge, as the number of samples increases, to an optimal solution (namely, the Differential Probabilistic RoadMap algorithm and the Differential Fast Marching Tree algorithm). Our focus is on driftless control-affine dynamical models, which accurately model a large class of robotic systems. In this paper we use the notion of convergence in probability (as opposed to convergence almost surely): the extra mathematical flexibility of this approach yields convergence rate bounds - a first in the field of optimal sampling-based motion planning under differential constraints. Numerical experiments corroborating our theoretical results are presented and discussed.},

  abstract = {Tractable safety-ensuring algorithms for cyber-physical systems are important in critical applications. Approaches based on Control Barrier Functions assume continuous enforcement, which is not possible in an online fashion. This paper presents two tractable algorithms to ensure forward invariance of discrete-time controlled cyber-physical systems. Both approaches are based on Control Barrier Functions to provide strict mathematical safety guarantees. The first algorithm exploits Lipschitz continuity and formulates the safety condition as a robust program which is subsequently relaxed to a set of affine conditions. The second algorithm is inspired by tube-NMPC and uses an affine Control Barrier Function formulation in conjunction with an auxiliary controller to guarantee safety of the system. We combine an approximate NMPC controller with the second algorithm to guarantee strict safety despite approximated constraints and show its effectiveness experimentally on a mini-Segway.},

  abstract = {In e-commerce warehouses, online retailers increase their efficiency by using a mixed-shelves (or scattered storage) concept, where unit loads are purposefully broken down into single items, which are individually stored in multiple locations. Irrespective of the stock keeping units a customer jointly orders, this storage strategy increases the likelihood that somewhere in the warehouse the items of the requested stock keeping units will be in close vicinity, which may significantly reduce an order picker's unproductive walking time. This paper optimizes picker routing through such mixed-shelves warehouses. Specifically, we introduce a generic exact algorithm that covers a multitude of picking policies, independently of the underlying picking zone layout, and is suitable for real-time applications. Besides its generality, this algorithm provides a new state of the art in terms of solvable instance sizes and computational times, providing average reductions of 67\% compared with the best known algorithm. Using this algorithm we compare three different real-world e-commerce warehouse settings that differ slightly in their application of scattered storage and in their picking policies. Our results reveal that the right combination of drop-off points, dynamic batching, the utilization of picking carts, and the picking zone layout can greatly improve the picking performance. In particular, some combinations of policies yield efficiency increases of more than 30\%.},

  abstract = {To achieve seamless human-robot interactions, robots need to intimately reason about complex interaction dynamics and future human behaviors within their motion planning process. However, there is a disconnect between state-of-the-art neural network-based human behavior models and robot motion planners---either the behavior models are limited in their consideration of downstream planning or a simplified behavior model is used to ensure tractability of the planning problem. In this work, we present a framework that fuses together the interpretability and flexibility of trajectory optimization (TO) with the predictive power of state-of-the-art human trajectory prediction models. In particular, we leverage gradient information from data-driven prediction models to explicitly reason about human-robot interaction dynamics within a gradient-based TO problem. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in a multi-agent scenario whereby a robot is required to safely and efficiently navigate through a crowd of up to ten pedestrians. We compare against a variety of planning methods, and show that by explicitly accounting for interaction dynamics within the planner, our method offers safer and more efficient behaviors, even yielding proactive and nuanced behaviors such as waiting for a pedestrian to pass before moving.},

Such cooperative interactions are ever more sophisticated. Thus, the ability to reason not just about a human's center of gravity position, but also its granular motion is an important prerequisite for human-robot interaction. Though, many algorithms ignore the multimodal nature of humans or neglect uncertainty in their motion forecasts. We present Motron, a multimodal, probabilistic, graph-structured model, that captures human's multimodality using probabilistic methods while being able to output deterministic motions and corresponding confidence values for each mode. Our model aims to be tightly integrated with the robotic planning-control-interaction loop; outputting physically feasible human motions and being computationally efficient. We demonstrate the performance of our model on several challenging real-world motion forecasting datasets, outperforming a wide array of generative methods while providing state-of-the-art deterministic motions if required.

  abstract = {Model Predictive Control (MPC) has become a popular framework in embedded control for high-performance autonomous systems. However, to achieve good control performance using MPC, an accurate dynamics model is key. To maintain real-time operation, the dynamics models used on embedded systems have been limited to simple first-principle models, which substantially limits their representative power. In contrast to such simple models, machine learning approaches, specifically neural networks, have been shown to accurately model even complex dynamic effects, but their large computational complexity hindered combination with fast real-time iteration loops. With this work, we present Real-time Neural MPC, a framework to efficiently integrate large, complex neural network architectures as dynamics models within a model-predictive control pipeline. Our experiments, performed in simulation and the real world onboard a highly agile quadrotor platform, demonstrate the capabilities of the described system to run learned models with, previously infeasible, large modeling capacity using gradient-based online optimization MPC. Compared to prior implementations of neural networks in online optimization MPC we can leverage models of over 4000 times larger parametric capacity in a 50Hz real-time window on an embedded platform. Further, we show the feasibility of our framework on real-world problems by reducing the positional tracking error by up to 82% when compared to state-of-the-art MPC approaches without neural network dynamics.},

This approximation largely retains the key features of the BPR model, while allowing the design of a real-time, convex quadratic optimization algorithm to determine congestion-aware routes for an AMoD fleet. Through a real-world case study of Manhattan, we compare CARS to existing routing approaches, namely a congestion-unaware and a threshold congestion model.

We model the problem within a network flow framework and show that under relatively mild assumptions the rebalancing vehicles, if properly coordinated, do not lead to an increase in congestion (in stark contrast to common belief). From an algorithmic standpoint, such theoretical insight suggests that the problem of routing customers and rebalancing vehicles can be decoupled, which leads to a computationally-efficient routing and rebalancing algorithm for the autonomous vehicles. Numerical experiments and case studies corroborate our theoretical insights and show that the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art point-to-point methods by avoiding excess congestion on the road. Collectively, this paper provides a rigorous approach to the problem of congestion-aware, system-wide coordination of autonomously driving vehicles, and to the characterization of the sustainability of such robotic systems.},

We prove a lower bound on the bandwidth complexity of the consensus problem and provide a consensus algorithm that is bandwidth-optimal for a wide class of consensus functions. We then propose a distributed algorithm that can trade communication complexity versus time complexity as a function of a tunable parameter, which can be adjusted by a system designer as a function of the properties of the wireless communication channel.

  abstract = {The past decade has witnessed a rapidly growing interest in decentralized algorithms for collective decision-making in cyber-physical networks. For a large variety of settings, control strategies are now known that either minimize time complexity (i.e., convergence time) or optimize communication complexity (i.e., number and size of exchanged messages). Yet, little attention has beed paid to the problem of studying the inherent trade-off between time and communication complexity. Generally speaking, time-optimal algorithms are fast and robust, but require a large (and sometimes impractical) number of exchanged messages; in contrast, communication optimal algorithms minimize the amount of information routed through the network, but are slow and sensitive to link failures. In this paper we address this gap by focusing on a generalized version of the decentralized consensus problem (that includes voting and mediation) on undirected network topologies and in the presence of "infrequent" link failures. We present and rigorously analyze a tunable, semi-hierarchical algorithm, where the tuning parameter allows a graceful transition from time-optimal to communication-optimal performance (hence, allowing hybrid performance metrics), and determines the algorithm's robustness, measured as the time required to recover from a failure. An interesting feature of our algorithm is that it leads the decision-making agents to self-organize into a semi-hierarchical structure with variable-size clusters, among which information is flooded. Our results make use of a novel connection between the consensus problem and the theory of gamma synchronizers. Simulation experiments are presented and discussed.},

  abstract = {Autonomous Mobility-on-Demand systems (that is, fleets of self-driving cars offering on-demand transportation) hold promise to reshape urban transportation by offering high quality of service at lower cost compared to private vehicles. However, the impact of such systems on the infrastructure of our cities (and in particular on traffic congestion and the electric power network) is an active area of research. In particular, Autonomous Mobility-on-Demand (AMoD) systems could greatly increase traffic congestion due to additional "rebalancing" trips required to re-align the distribution of available vehicles with customer demand; furthermore, charging of large fleets of electric vehicles can induce significantly stress in the electric power network, leading to high electricity prices and potential network instability. In this thesis, we build analytical tools and algorithms to model and control the interaction between AMoD systems and our cities. We open our work by exploring the interaction between AMoD systems and urban congestion. Leveraging the theory of network flows, we devise models for AMoD systems that capture endogenous traffic congestion and are amenable to efficient optimization. These models allow us to show the key theoretical result that, under mild assumptions that are substantially verified for U.S. cities, AMoD systems do not increase congestion compared to privately-owned vehicles for a given level of customer demand if empty-traveling vehicles are properly routed. We leverage this insight to design a real-time congestion-aware routing algorithm for empty vehicles; microscopic agent-based simulations with New York City taxi data show that the algorithm significantly reduces congestion compared to a state-of-the-art congestion-agnostic rebalancing algorithm, resulting in 22\% lower wait times for AMoD customers. We then devise a randomized congestion-aware routing algorithm for customer-carrying vehicles and prove rigorous analytical bounds on its performance. Preliminary results based on New York City taxi data show that the algorithm could yield a further reduction in congestion and, as a result, 5\% lower service times for AMoD customers. We then turn our attention to the interaction between AMoD fleets with electric vehicles and the power network. We extend the network flow model developed in the first part of the thesis to capture the vehicles' state-of-charge and their interaction with the power network (including charging and the ability to inject power in the network in exchange for a payment, denoted as "vehicle-to-grid"). We devise an algorithmic procedure to losslessly reduce the size of the resulting model, making it amenable to efficient optimization, and test our models and optimization algorithms on a hypothetical deployment of an AMoD system in Dallas-Fort Worth, TX with the goal of maximizing social welfare. Simulation results show that coordination between the AMoD system and the power network can reduce electricity prices by over \$180M/year, with savings of \$120M/year for local power network customers and \$35M/year for the AMoD operator. In order to realize such benefits, the transportation operator must cooperate with the power network: we prove that a pricing scheme can be used to enforce the socially optimal solution as a general equilibrium, aligning the interests of a self-interested transportation operator and self-interested power generators with the goal of maximizing social welfare. We then design privacy-preserving algorithms to compute such coordination-promoting prices in a distributed fashion. Finally, we propose a receding-horizon implementation that trades off optimality for speed and demonstrate that it can be deployed in real-time with microscopic simulations in Dallas-Fort Worth. Collectively, these results lay the foundations for congestion-aware and power-aware control of AMoD systems; in particular, the models and algorithms in this thesis provide tools that will enable transportation network operators and urban planners to foster the positive externalities of AMoD and avoid the negative ones, thus fully realizing the benefits of AMoD systems in our cities.},

  abstract = {Autonomous systems have played an important role in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. Notably, there have been multiple attempts to leverage Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to disinfect surfaces. Although recent research suggests that surface transmission has a minimal impact in the spread of Covid-19, surfaces do play a significant role in the transmission of many other viruses. Employing UAVs for mass spray disinfection offers several potential advantages including high throughput application of disinfectant, large scale deployment, and the minimization of health risks to sanitation workers. Despite these potential benefits and preliminary usage of UAVs for disinfection, there has been little research into their design and effectiveness. In this work we present an autonomous UAV capable of effectively disinfecting surfaces. We identify relevant parameters such as disinfectant concentration, amount, and application distance required of the UAV to sterilize high touch surfaces such as door handles. Finally, we develop a robotic system that enables the fully autonomous disinfection of door handles in an unstructured, previously unknown environment. To our knowledge, this is the smallest untethered UAV ever built with both full autonomy and spraying capabilities, allowing it to operate in confined indoor settings, and the first autonomous UAV to specifically target high touch surfaces on an individual basis with spray disinfectant, resulting in more efficient use of disinfectant.},

For general nonlinear models, including those fit to data, there may not be enough known structure to reliably synthesize a stabilizing feedback controller. In this paper, we discuss a state-dependent nonlinear tracking controller formulation based on a state-dependent Riccati equation for general nonlinear control-affine systems. This formulation depends on a nonlinear factorization of the system of vector fields defining the control-affine dynamics, which always exists under mild smoothness assumptions. We propose a method for learning this factorization from a finite set of data. On a variety of simulated nonlinear dynamical systems, we empirically demonstrate the efficacy of learned versions of this controller in stable trajectory tracking. Alongside our learning method, we evaluate recent ideas in jointly learning a controller and stabilizability certificate for known dynamical systems; we show experimentally that such methods can be frail in comparison.},

  abstract = {Directed in-situ science and exploration on the surface of small Solar System bodies requires controlled mobility. In the microgravity environment of small bodies such as asteroids, comets or small moons, the low gravitational and frictional forces at the surface make typical wheeled rovers ineffective. Through a joint collaboration, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory together with Stanford University have been studying microgravity mobility approaches using hopping/tumbling platforms. They have developed an internally-actuated spacecraft/rover hybrid platform, known as "Hedgehog", that uses flywheels and brakes to impart mobility. This paper presents a model of the platform's mobility, analyzing its three main states of motion (pivoting, slipping and hopping) and the contact dynamics between the platform's spikes and various regolith simulants. To experimentally validate the model, an Atwood machine (pulley and counterbalance) was used to emulate microgravity. Experiments were performed with a range of torques on both rigid and granular surfaces while a high-speed camera tracked the platform's motion. Using parameters measured during the experiments, the platform was simulated numerically and its motion compared. Within the limits of the experimental setup, the model is consistent with observations; it indicates the ability to perform controlled forward motions in microgravity on a range of rigid and granular regolith simulants.},

  abstract = {Future planetary explorations envisioned by the National Research Council's (NRC's) Vision and Voyages for Planetary Science in the Decade 2013-2022, developed at the request of NASA the Science Mission Directorate (SMD) Planetary Science Division (PSD), seek to reach targets of broad scientific interest across the solar system. This goal can be achieved by missions with next-generation capabilities such as innovative interplanetary trajectory solutions, highly accurate landings, the ability to be in close proximity to targets of interest, advanced pointing precision, multiple spacecraft in collaboration, multitarget tours, and advanced robotic surface exploration. Advancements in guidance, navigation, and control (GN\&C) and mission design-ranging from software and algorithm development to new sensors-will be necessary to enable these future missions. Spacecraft GN\&C technologies have been evolving since the launch of the first rocket. Guidance is defined to be the onboard determination of the desired path of travel from the vehicle's current location to a designated target. Navigation is defined as the science behind transporting ships, aircraft, or spacecraft from place to place; particularly, the method of determining position, course, and distance traveled as well as the determination of the time reference. Control is defined as the onboard manipulation of vehicle steering controls to track guidance commands while maintaining vehicle pointing with the required precision. As missions become more complex, technological demands on GN\&C increase, and so continuous technology progress is necessary. Recognizing the significance of this research, the NRC of the National Academies listed many GN\&C technologies as top priorities in the recently released NASA Space Technology Roadmaps and Priorities: Restoring NASA's Technological Edge and Paving the Way for a New Era in Space. This document-Part III, Surface Guidance, Navigation, and Control-is the third, and last, in a series of technology assessments evaluating the capabilities and technologies needed for future missions pursuing SMD PSD's scientific goals. These reports cover the status of technologies and provide findings and recommendations to NASA PSD for future needs in GN\&C and mission design technologies. Part I covers planetary mission design in general, as well as the estimation and control of vehicle flight paths when flight path and attitude dynamics may be treated as decoupled or only loosely coupled (as is the case the majority of the time in a typical planetary mission). Part II, Onboard Guidance, Navigation, and Control, covers attitude estimation and control in general, as well as the estimation and control of vehicle flight paths when flight path and attitude dynamics are strongly coupled (as is the case during certain critical phases, such as entry, descent, and landing, in some planetary missions). Part III, Surface Guidance, Navigation, and Control, examines GN\&C for vehicles that are not in free flight, but that operate on or near the surface of a natural body of the solar system. It should be noted that this is the first time that Surface GNC has been assessed and requirements given for future missions. Together, these documents provide the PSD with a roadmap for achieving science missions in the next decade},

Routing service vehicles through customers is usually accomplished with heuristic algorithms. In this paper we study TOD systems in a formal setting that allows us to characterize fundamental performance limits and devise dynamic routing policies with provable performance guarantees. Specifically, we study TOD systems in the form of a unit-capacity, multiple-vehicle dynamic pick-up and delivery problem, whereby pick-up requests arrive according to a Poisson process and are randomly located according to a general probability density. Corresponding delivery locations are also randomly distributed according to a general probability density, and a number of unit-capacity vehicles must transport demands from their pick-up locations to their delivery locations. We derive insightful fundamental bounds on the steady-state waiting times for the demands, and we devise constant-factor optimal dynamic routing policies. Simulation results are presented and discussed.},

  abstract = {In this paper we study a dynamic vehicle routing problem in which there are multiple vehicles and multiple classes of demands. Demands of each class arrive in the environment randomly over time and require a random amount of on-site service that is characteristic of the class. To service a demand, one of the vehicles must travel to the demand location and remain there for the required on-site service time. The quality of service provided to each class is given by the expected delay between the arrival of a demand in the class, and that demand's service completion. The goal is to design a routing policy for the service vehicles which minimizes a convex combination of the delays for each class. First, we provide a lower bound on the achievable values of the convex combination of delays. Then, we propose a novel routing policy and analyze its performance under heavy load conditions (i.e., when the fraction of time the service vehicles spend performing on-site service approaches one). The policy performs within a constant factor of the lower bound (and thus the optimal), where the constant depends only on the number of classes, and is independent of the number of vehicles, the arrival rates of demands, the on-site service times, and the convex combination coefficients.},

  abstract = {We study an online hypergraph matching problem with delays, motivated by ridesharing applications. In this model, users enter a marketplace sequentially, and are willing to wait up to d timesteps to be matched, after which they will leave the system in favor of an outside option. A platform can match groups of up to k users together, indicating that they will share a ride. Each group of users yields a match value depending on how compatible they are with one another. As an example, in ridesharing, k is the capacity of the service vehicles, and d is the amount of time a user is willing to wait for a driver to be matched to them. We present results for both the utility maximization and cost minimization variants of the problem. In the utility maximization setting, the optimal competitive ratio is 1/d whenever k is at least 3, and is achievable in polynomial-time for any fixed k. In the cost minimization variation, when k = 2, the optimal competitive ratio for deterministic algorithms is 3/2 and is achieved by a polynomial-time thresholding algorithm. When k>2, we show that a polynomial-time randomized batching algorithm is (2 - 1/d) log k-competitive, and it is NP-hard to achieve a competitive ratio better than log k - O(log log k).},

For the cost minimization setting, we assume costs are monotone, which is a natural assumption in ridesharing and delivery problems. When k = 2, we show that the optimal competitive ratio for deterministic algorithms is \frac{3}{2} and is achieved by a polynomial-time thresholding algorithm. When k>2, we show that a polynomial-time randomized batching algorithm is (2 - 1/d)log k-competitive, and it is NP-hard to achieve a competitive ratio better than $\log k - O (\log \log k)$.},

The best previously known control algorithms rely on centralized, a-priori task assignment, and are therefore of limited applicability in scenarios involving large ad-hoc networks of autonomous vehicles. By combining results from geometric probability and locational optimization, we provide a policy that solves, providing a constant-factor approximation to the optimal achievable performance, the decentralized version of the m-DTRP; such policy (i) does not rely on centralized and a priori task assignment, (ii) is spatially distributed, scalable to large networks, and adaptive to network changes.

The vehicles must service demands whose time of arrival, spatial location, and service requirement are stochastic; the objective is to minimize the average time demands spend in the system. The general problem is known as the m-vehicle Dynamic Traveling Repairman Problem (m-DTRP). The best previously known control algorithms rely on centralized task assignment and are not robust against changes in the environment. In this paper, we first devise new control policies for the 1-DTRP that: i) are provably optimal both in light-load conditions (i.e., when the arrival rate for the demands is small) and in heavy-load conditions (i.e., when the arrival rate for the demands is large), and ii) are adaptive, in particular, they are robust against changes in load conditions. Then, we show that specific partitioning policies, whereby the environment is partitioned among the vehicles and each vehicle follows a certain set of rules within its own region, are optimal in heavy-load conditions. Building upon the previous results, we finally design control policies for the m-DTRP that i) are adaptive and distributed, and ii) have strong performance guarantees in heavy-load conditions and stabilize the system in any load condition.},

Specifically, a network of robotic vehicles must service demands whose time of arrival, location and on-site service are stochastic; moreover, once a demand arrives, it remains active for a stochastic amount of time, and then expires. An active demand is successfully serviced when one of the vehicles visits its location before its deadline and provide the required on-site service. The aim is to find the minimum number of vehicles needed to ensure that the steady-state probability that a demand is successfully serviced is larger than a desired value, and to determine the policy the vehicles should execute to ensure that such objective is attained. First, we carefully formulate the problem, and we show its well-posedness by providing some novel ergodic results. Second, we provide a lower bound on the optimal number of vehicles; finally, we analyze two service policies, and we show that one of them is optimal in light load.

  abstract = {This study investigated a novel mission architecture where a long-reach crawling and anchoring robot, which repurposes extendable booms for mobile manipulation, is deployed to explore and sample difficult terrains on solar system bodies, with a key focus on Mars exploration. To this end, the robot concept introduced by this effort, called ReachBot, uses rollable extendable booms as manipulator arms and as highly reconfigurable structural members. ReachBot is capable of (1) rapid and versatile crawling through sequences of long-distance grasps, (2) traversing a large workspace while anchored (by adjusting boom lengths and orientations), and (3) applying high interaction forces and torques, primarily leveraging boom tensile strength and the variety of anchors within reach. These features allow a light and compact robot to achieve versatile mobility and forceful interaction in traditionally difficult environments such as vertical cliff walls or the rocky and uneven interiors of caves on Mars (see figure, left). In particular, ReachBot is uniquely suited for exploring and sampling Noachian targets on Mars that contain key sources of historical and astrobiological information preserved in strata in the form of cliff-face fractures and sublimation pits [1]. To develop this concept, this Phase I study brought together an interdisciplinary team of experts in robot autonomy, robotic manipulation, mechanical design, bio-inspired grasping, and geological planetary science from Stanford.},

At a general level, a mother spacecraft would deploy on the surface of a small body one, or several, spacecraft/rover hybrids, which are small (<= 5 kg, ~15 Watts), multi-faceted robots enclosing three mutually orthogonal flywheels and surrounded by external spikes (in particular, there is no external propulsion). By accelerating/decelerating the flywheels and by exploiting the low gravity environment, the hybrids would be capable of performing both long excursions (by hopping) and short traverses to specific locations (through a sequence of controlled "tumbles"). Their control would rely on synergistic operations with the mother spacecraft (where most of hybrids perception and localization functionalities would be hosted), which would make the platforms minimalistic and in turn the entire mission architecture affordable. Specifically, in the first part of the paper we present preliminary models and laboratory experiments for the hybrids, first-order estimates for critical subsystems, and a preliminary study for synergistic mission operations. In the second part, we tailor our mission architecture to the exploration of Mars' moon Phobos. The mission aims at exploring Phobos' Stickney crater, whose spectral similarities with C-type asteroids and variety of terrain properties make it a particularly interesting exploration target to address both high-priority science for the Martian system and strategic knowledge gaps for the future human exploration of Mars.},

For example, a service request may represent the detection of an event in a sensor network application, which needs to be investigated on site. Once a service request has been generated, it remains active for an amount of time which is itself a random variable, and then expires. The problem we investigate is the following: What is the minimum number of mobile agents needed to ensure that each service request is fulfilled before expiring, with probability at least 1 - $\eps$? What strategy should they use to ensure this objective is attained? Formulating the probability of successfully servicing requests before expiration as a performance metric, we derive bounds on the minimum number of agents required to ensure a given performance level, and present decentralized motion coordination algorithms that approximate the optimal strategy.},

Specific problems we investigate are the following: what is the minimum number of mobile agents needed to ensure that a certain fraction of service requests is fulfilled before expiration? What strategy should they use to ensure that this objective is attained? This problem can be viewed as the stochastic and dynamic version of the well-known vehicle routing problem with time windows. We also extend our analysis to the case in which the time service requests remain active is itself a random variable, describing customer impatience. The customers' impatience is only known to the mobile agents via prior statistics. In this case, it is desired to minimize the fraction of service requests missed because of impatience.

The current lack of distributed algorithms for the computation of equitable partitions limits the applicability of equitable partitioning policies to limited-size multiagent systems operating in known, static environments. In this paper, first we design provably correct and spatially distributed algorithms that allow a team of agents to compute a convex and equitable partition of a convex environment. Second, we discuss how these algorithms can be extended so that a team of agents can compute, in a spatially distributed fashion, convex and equitable partitions with additional features, e.g., equitable and median Voronoi diagrams. Finally, we discuss two application domains for our algorithms, namely dynamic vehicle routing for mobile robotic networks and wireless ad hoc networks. Through these examples, we show how one can couple the algorithms presented in this paper with equitable partitioning policies to make these amenable to distributed implementation. More in general, we illustrate a systematic approach to devise spatially distributed control policies for a large variety of multiagent coordination problems.

This dissertation develops concepts and algorithms for dynamic vehicle routing (DVR), that is, for the automatic planning of optimal multi-vehicle routes to provide service to demands (or more generally to perform tasks) that are generated over time by an exogenous process. We consider a rich variety of scenarios relevant for robotic applications. We begin by reviewing some of the approaches available to tackle DVR problems. Next, we study different multi-vehicle scenarios based on different models for demands (in particular, demands with time constraints, demands with different priority levels, and demands that must be transported from a pick-up to a delivery location). The performance criterion used in these scenarios is either the expected waiting time of the demands or the fraction of demands serviced successfully. In each specific DVR scenario we adopt a rigorous technical approach, which we call algorithmic queueing theory and which relies upon methods from queueing theory, combinatorial optimization, and stochastic geometry. Algorithmic queueing theory consists of three basics steps: 1) queueing model of the DVR problem and analysis of its structure; 2) establishment of fundamental limitations on performance, independent of algorithms; and 3) design of algorithms that are either optimal or constant-factor away from optimal. In the second part of the dissertation, we address problems concerning the implementation of routing policies in large-scale robotic networks, such as adaptivity and decentralized computation. We first present distributed algorithms for environment partitioning, and then we apply them to devise routing policies for DVR problems that (i) are spatially distributed, scalable to large networks, and adaptive to network changes, and (ii) have remarkably good performance guarantees. The technical approach developed in this dissertation is applicable to a wide variety of DVR problems: several possible extensions are discussed throughout the thesis.},

  abstract = {Existing approaches to constrained dynamic programming are limited to formulations where the constraints share the same additive structure of the objective function (that is, they can be represented as an expectation of the summation of one-stage costs). As such, these formulations cannot handle joint probabilistic (chance) constraints, whose structure is not additive. To bridge this gap, this paper presents a novel algorithmic approach for joint chance-constrained dynamic programming problems, where the probability of failure to satisfy given state constraints is explicitly bounded. Our approach is to (conservatively) reformulate a joint chance constraint as a constraint on the expectation of a summation of indicator random variables, which can be incorporated into the cost function by considering a dual formulation of the optimization problem. As a result, the primal variables can be optimized by standard dynamic programming, while the dual variable is optimized by a root-finding algorithm that converges exponentially. Error bounds on the primal and dual objective values are rigorously derived. We demonstrate algorithm effectiveness on three optimal control problems, namely a path planning problem, a Mars entry, descent and landing problem, and a Lunar landing problem. All Mars simulations are conducted using real terrain data of Mars, with four million discrete states at each time step. The numerical experiments are used to validate our theoretical and heuristic arguments that the proposed algorithm is both (i) computationally efficient, i.e., capable of handling real-world problems, and (ii) near-optimal, i.e., its degree of conservatism is very low.},

The control algorithm relies on mode insertion gradient optimization for this risk measure as well as Monte Carlo sampling from Trajectron++, a state-of-the-art generative model that produces multimodal probabilistic trajectory forecasts for multiple interacting agents. Our modular approach decouples the crowd-robot interaction into learning-based prediction and model-based control, which is advantageous compared to end-to-end policy learning methods in that it allows the robot's desired behavior to be specified at run time. In particular, we show that the robot exhibits diverse interaction behavior by varying the risk sensitivity parameter. A simulation study and a real-world experiment show that the proposed online framework can accomplish safe and efficient navigation while avoiding collisions with more than 50 humans in the scene.},

  note      = {Submitted},
  abstract  = {Motion planning for a multi-limbed climbing robot must consider the robot’s posture, joint torques, and how it uses contact forces to interact with its environment. This paper focuses on motion planning for a robot that uses nontraditional locomotion to explore unpredictable environments such as a martian cave. Our robotic concept, ReachBot, uses extendable and retractable booms as limbs to achieve a large reachable workspace while climbing. Each extendable boom is capped by a microspine gripper optimized for grasping in martian caves. ReachBot leverages its large workspace to navigate around obstacles, over crevasses, and through challenging terrain. Our planning approach must be versatile to accommodate variable terrain features and be robust to mitigate risks from the stochastic nature of spiny grippers. In this paper, we introduce a graph traversal algorithm to select a discrete sequence of grasps based on available terrain features suitable for grasping.  This discrete plan is complemented by a decoupled motion planner that considers the alternating phases of body movement and end-effector movement, using a combination of sampling-based planning and sequential convex programming to optimize individual phases. We use our motion planner to plan a trajectory across a simulated 2D cave environment with at least 95\% probability of success and demonstrate improved robustness over a baseline trajectory. Finally, we verify our motion planning algorithm through experimentation on a 2D planar prototype.},

First, we use experimental data to formulate a physically realistic collision model for the spacecraft. We show that this model is linear over the expected operational range, enabling a piecewise affine representation of the full hybrid-vehicle dynamics. Next, we incorporate this dynamics model along with vehicle constraints into a mixed integer program. Experimental comparisons of trajectories with and without collision-avoidance requirements demonstrate the capability of the collision-tolerant strategy to achieve significant performance improvements in realistic scenarios. A simulated case study illustrates the potential for this approach to find damage-mitigating paths in online implementations.},

  year         = {2020},
  abstract = {A model predictive control algorithm seeks to produce a control law that optimizes the future behavior of a deployed system over a finite time horizon, by leveraging a real-time computational model of this system. For applications involving fluid-structure interaction (FSI), this leveraging is challenging because it implies the design of an accurate and yet real-time computational model for the prediction of the time-dependent flow-induced forces and moments acting on the system. The projection-based reduction of CFD-based computational models for FSI provides one approach for addressing this issue. In this context, linear model reduction is adequate as the controller can be expected to maintain the system of interest within small perturbations around a pre-designed optimal trajectory. For the automated landing of an aircraft application considered in this paper, this requires the construction of a CFD-based projection-based reduced-order model that is linearized around a time-dependent trajectory rather than a mere steady-state equilibrium position. To this end, a computational approach for the projection-based model order reduction of linearized CFD-based computational models for FSI is presented, with the goal of application to downstream control tasks such as automated aircraft landing. The approach addresses the issues of linearization around a trajectory and construction of stable reduced-order models to achieve real-time computation, while maintaining model accuracy, and thereby enabling model predictive control. It is verified using a simple model predictive control algorithm.},

It features a digital twin instance for model predictive control; and an innovative, real-time, digital twin prototype for fluid-structure interaction and flight dynamics to inform it. The latter digital twin is based on the linearization about a pre-designed glideslope trajectory of a high-fidelity, viscous, nonlinear computational model for flight dynamics; and its projection onto a low-dimensional approximation subspace to achieve real-time performance, while maintaining accuracy. Its main purpose is to predict in real-time, during flight, the state of an aircraft and the aerodynamic forces and moments acting on it. Unlike static lookup tables or regression-based surrogate models based on steady-state wind tunnel data, the aforementioned real-time digital twin prototype allows the digital twin instance for model predictive control to be informed by a truly dynamic flight model, rather than a less accurate set of steady-state aerodynamic force and moment data points. The paper describes in details the construction of the proposed two-level digital twin concept and its verification by numerical simulation. It also reports on its preliminary flight validation in autonomous mode for an off-the-shelf unmanned aerial vehicle instrumented at Stanford University.},

The goal of this article is to provide a comprehensive tutorial of three major convex optimization-based trajectory generation methods:  lossless convexification (LCvx), and two sequential convex programming algorithms known as SCvx and GuSTO. In this article, trajectory generation is the computation of a dynamically feasible state and control signal that satisfies a set of constraints while optimizing key mission objectives.  The trajectory generation problem is almost always nonconvex, which typically means that it is not readily amenable to efficient and reliable solution onboard an autonomous vehicle.  The three algorithms that we discuss use problem reformulation and a systematic algorithmic strategy to nonetheless solve nonconvex trajectory generation tasks through the use of a convex optimizer. The theoretical guarantees and computational speed offered by convex optimization have made the algorithms popular in both research and industry circles.  To date, the list of applications include rocket landing, spacecraft hypersonic reentry, spacecraft rendezvous and docking, aerial motion planning for fixed-wing and quadrotor vehicles, robot motion planning, and more.  Among these applications are high-profile rocket flights conducted by organizations like NASA, Masten Space Systems, SpaceX, and Blue Origin. This article aims to give the reader the tools and understanding necessary to work with each algorithm, and to know what each method can and cannot do. A publicly available source code repository supports the numerical examples provided at the end of this article.

  abstract = {The literature on Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) typically assumes that humans take actions in order to minimize the expected value of a cost function, i.e., that humans are risk neutral. Yet, in practice, humans are often far from being risk neutral. To fill this gap, the objective of this paper is to devise a framework for risk-sensitive IRL in order to explicitly account for an expert's risk sensitivity. To this end, we propose a flexible class of models based on coherent risk metrics, which allow us to capture an entire spectrum of risk preferences from risk-neutral to worst-case. We propose efficient algorithms based on Linear Programming for inferring an expert's underlying risk metric and cost function for a rich class of static and dynamic decision-making settings. The resulting approach is demonstrated on a simulated driving game with ten human participants. Our method is able to infer and mimic a wide range of qualitatively different driving styles from highly risk-averse to risk-neutral in a data-efficient manner. Moreover, comparisons of the Risk-Sensitive (RS) IRL approach with a risk-neutral model show that the RS-IRL framework more accurately captures observed participant behavior both qualitatively and quantitatively.},

  abstract = {Endowing robots with the capability of assessing risk and making risk-aware decisions is widely considered a key step toward ensuring safety for robots operating under uncertainty. But, how should a robot quantify risk? A natural and common approach is to consider the framework whereby costs are assigned to stochastic outcomes - an assignment captured by a cost random variable. Quantifying risk then corresponds to evaluating a risk metric, i.e., a mapping from the cost random variable to a real number. Yet, the question of what constitutes a "good" risk metric has received little attention within the robotics community. The goal of this paper is to explore and partially address this question by advocating axioms that risk metrics in robotics applications should satisfy in order to be employed as rational assessments of risk. We discuss general representation theorems that precisely characterize the class of metrics that satisfy these axioms (referred to as distortion risk metrics), and provide instantiations that can be used in applications. We further discuss pitfalls of commonly used risk metrics in robotics, and discuss additional properties that one must consider in sequential decision making tasks. Our hope is that the ideas presented here will lead to a foundational framework for quantifying risk (and hence safety) in robotics applications.},

To reliably improve safety, these warning systems should have a provable false negative rate; i.e., of the situations than are unsafe, fewer than epsilon will occur without an alert. In this work, we present a framework that combines a statistical inference technique known as conformal prediction with a simulator of robot/environment dynamics, in order to tune warning systems to provably achieve an epsilon false negative rate using as few as 1/epsilon data points. We apply our framework to a driver warning system and a robotic grasping application, and empirically demonstrate guaranteed false negative rate and low false detection (positive) rate using very little data.},

  abstract  = {When deploying modern machine learning-enabled robotic systems in high-stakes applications, detecting distributional shift is critical. However, most existing methods for detecting distribution shift are not well-suited to robotics settings, where data often arrives in a streaming fashion and may be very high-dimensional. In this work, we present an online method for detecting distributional shift with guarantees on the false positive rate --- i.e., when there is no distribution shift, our system is very unlikely (with probability $< \epsilon$) to falsely issue an alert; any alerts that are issued should therefore be heeded. Our method is specifically designed for efficient detection even with high dimensional data, and it empirically achieves up to 6x faster detection on realistic robotics settings compared to prior work while maintaining a low false negative rate in practice (whenever there is a distribution shift in our experiments, our method indeed emits an alert).},

  year         = {2022},
  abstract = {Probabilistic classifiers output confidence scores along with their predictions, and these confidence scores should be calibrated, i.e., they should reflect the reliability of the prediction. Confidence scores that minimize standard metrics such as the expected calibration error (ECE) accurately measure the reliability on average across the entire population. However, it is in general impossible to measure the reliability of an individual prediction. In this work, we propose the local calibration error (LCE) to span the gap between average and individual reliability. For each individual prediction, the LCE measures the average reliability of a set of similar predictions, where similarity is quantified by a kernel function on a pretrained feature space and by a binning scheme over predicted model confidences. We show theoretically that the LCE can be estimated sample-efficiently from data, and empirically find that it reveals miscalibration modes that are more fine-grained than the ECE can detect. Our key result is a novel local recalibration method LoRe, to improve confidence scores for individual predictions and decrease the LCE. Experimentally, we show that our recalibration method produces more accurate confidence scores, which improves downstream fairness and decision making on classification tasks with both image and tabular data.},

  year         = {2021},
  abstract = {Charging infrastructure is the coupling link between power and transportation networks, thus determining charging station siting is necessary for planning of power and transportation systems. While previous works have either optimized for charging station siting given historic travel behavior, or optimized fleet routing and charging given an assumed placement of the stations, this paper introduces a linear program that optimizes for station siting and macroscopic fleet operations in a joint fashion. Given an electricity retail rate and a set of travel demand requests, the optimization minimizes total cost for an autonomous EV fleet comprising of travel costs, station procurement costs, fleet procurement costs, and electricity costs, including demand charges. Specifically, the optimization returns the number of charging plugs for each charging rate (e.g., Level 2, DC fast charging) at each candidate location, as well as the optimal routing and charging of the fleet. From a case-study of an electric vehicle fleet operating in San Francisco, our results show that, albeit with range limitations, small EVs with low procurement costs and high energy efficiencies are the most cost-effective in terms of total ownership costs. Furthermore, the optimal siting of charging stations is more spatially distributed than the current siting of stations, consisting mainly of high-power Level 2 AC stations (16.8 kW) with a small share of DC fast charging stations and no standard 7.7kW Level 2 stations. Optimal siting reduces the total costs, empty vehicle travel, and peak charging load by up to 10%.},

  abstract = {Model predictive control is a powerful framework for enabling optimal control of constrained systems. However, for systems that are described by high-dimensional state spaces this framework can be too computationally demanding for real-time control. Reduced order model predictive control (ROMPC) frameworks address this issue by leveraging model reduction techniques to compress the state space model used in the online optimal control problem. While this can enable real-time control by decreasing the online computational requirements, these model reductions introduce approximation errors that must be accounted for to guarantee constraint satisfaction and closed-loop stability for the controlled high-dimensional system. In this work we propose an offline methodology for efficiently computing error bounds arising from model reduction, and show how they can be used to guarantee constraint satisfaction in a previously proposed ROMPC framework. This work considers linear, discrete, time-invariant systems that are compressed by Petrov-Galerkin projections, and considers output-feedback settings where the system is also subject to bounded disturbances.},

In this work we present a simple and efficient methodology for synthesizing a tube-based robust output feedback MPC scheme for linear, discrete, time-invariant systems subject to bounded, additive disturbances. Specifically, we completely avoid the use of Minkowski addition during controller synthesis and the online optimization problem has the same complexity as in the nominal full state feedback MPC problem, enabling our approach to scale with system dimension more effectively than previously proposed schemes.},

However, computational requirements for real-time control have limited their use to systems with low-dimensional models. Nevertheless, high-dimensional models arise in many settings, for example, discretization methods for generating finite-dimensional approximations to partial differential equations can result in models with thousands to millions of dimensions. In such cases, reduced-order models (ROMs) can significantly reduce computational requirements, but model approximation error must be considered to guarantee controller performance. In this article, a reduced-order model predictive control (ROMPC) scheme is proposed to solve robust, output feedback, constrained optimal control problems for high-dimensional linear systems. Computational efficiency is obtained by using projection-based ROMs, and guarantees on robust constraint satisfaction and stability are provided. The performance of the approach is demonstrated in simulation for several examples, including an aircraft control problem leveraging an inviscid computational fluid dynamics model with dimension 998 930.},

A promising solution approach is to leverage reduced order models for designing the model predictive controller. In this paper we present a reduced order MPC scheme that enables setpoint tracking while robustly guaranteeing constraint satisfaction for linear, discrete, time-invariant systems. Setpoint tracking is enabled by designing the MPC cost function to account for the steady-state error between the full and reduced order models. Robust constraint satisfaction is accomplished by solving (offline) a set of linear programs to provide bounds on the errors due to bounded disturbances, state estimation, and model approximation. The approach is validated on a synthetic system as well as a high-dimensional linear model of a flexible rod, obtained using finite element methods.},

This paper seeks to find attacker strategies in reach-avoid games that reduce computational complexity while retaining solution quality by using a receding horizon strategy. To solve for the open-loop strategy fast enough to enable an receding horizon approach, the problem is formulated as a mixed-integer second-order cone program. This formulation leverages the use of sums-of-squares optimization to provide guarantees that the strategy is robust to all possible defender policies.

  abstract = {Many physical systems are modeled by finite-dimensional sets of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Others have dynamics that evolve over a continuum (i.e. are infinite-dimensional) and are best modeled by partial differential equations (PDEs), including systems with fluid flows, deformable/flexible structures, or fluid-structure interaction. In practice, PDE models are generally semi-discretized to produce high-fidelity finite-dimensional ODE models. Since the dimension of these models can range from thousands to millions, computational challenges severely limit the use of standard approaches to model-based controller design. In this thesis, we propose an approach for efficiently designing high-performing controllers based on high-dimensional models. Specifically, we develop a model predictive control (MPC) algorithm for solving constrained optimal control problems that leverages high-fidelity, but low-dimensional, reduced order approximations of the original model to satisfy practical computational requirements. In the linear setting, we combine existing ideas from tube MPC with novel approaches for controller synthesis and analysis to develop a reduced order MPC (ROMPC) scheme for solving robust, output feedback control problems, and we provide theoretical closed-loop performance guarantees that explicitly account for model reduction error. We also extend the ROMPC scheme to the nonlinear setting by exploiting piecewise-affine reduced order models. We motivate and validate the proposed approach through two case studies. First, we use a linear, coupled rigid-body/fluid dynamics model for aircraft control, where the high-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model has over one million dimensions. Second, we use a nonlinear finite element model (FEM) with over ten thousand dimensions to control a soft robot. Simulation and hardware experiments are used in both studies to demonstrate the practicality and performance of ROMPC.},

We exploit these confidence sets to plan trajectories that guarantee the safety of the system. Our approach handles problems with high dynamics uncertainty where reaching the goal safely is initially infeasible by first exploring to gather data and reduce uncertainty, before autonomously exploiting the acquired information to safely perform the task. Under reasonable assumptions, we prove that our framework provides safety guarantees in the form of a single joint chance constraint. Furthermore, we use this theoretical analysis to motivate regularization of the model to improve performance. We extensively demonstrate our approach in simulation and on hardware.},

Paramount, however, is ensuring safety on the road---a key challenge in doing so is accounting for uncertainty in human driver actions without unduly impacting planner performance. This paper introduces a minimally-interventional safety controller operating within an autonomous vehicle control stack with the role of ensuring collision-free interaction with an externally controlled (e.g., human-driven) counterpart while respecting static obstacles such as a road boundary wall. We leverage reachability analysis to construct a real-time (100Hz) controller that serves the dual role of (1) tracking an input trajectory from a higher-level planning algorithm using model predictive control, and (2) assuring safety through maintaining the availability of a collision-free escape maneuver as a persistent constraint regardless of whatever future actions the other car takes. A full-scale steer-by-wire platform is used to conduct traffic weaving experiments wherein two cars, initially side-by-side, must swap lanes in a limited amount of time and distance, emulating cars merging onto/off of a highway. We demonstrate that, with our control stack, the autonomous vehicle is able to avoid collision even when the other car defies the planner's expectations and takes dangerous actions, either carelessly or with the intent to collide, and otherwise deviates minimally from the planned trajectory to the extent required to maintain safety.},

  abstract = {There are spatio-temporal rules that dictate how robots should operate in complex environments, e.g., road rules govern how (self-driving) vehicles should behave on the road. However, seamlessly incorporating such rules into a robot control policy remains challenging especially for real-time applications. In this work, given a desired spatio-temporal specification expressed in the Signal Temporal Logic (STL) language, we propose a semi-supervised controller synthesis technique that is attuned to human-like behaviors while satisfying desired STL specifications. Offline, we synthesize a trajectory-feedback neural network controller via an adversarial training scheme that summarizes past spatio-temporal behaviors when computing controls, and then online, we perform gradient steps to improve specification satisfaction. Central to the offline phase is an imitation-based regularization component that fosters better policy exploration and helps induce naturalistic human behaviors. Our experiments demonstrate that having imitation-based regularization leads to higher qualitative and quantitative performance compared to optimizing an STL objective only as done in prior work. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach with an illustrative case study and show that our proposed controller outperforms a state-of-the-art shooting method in both performance and computation time.},

  abstract = {Signal Temporal Logic (STL) is an expressive language used to describe logical and temporal properties of signals, both continuous and discrete. Inferring STL formulas from behavior traces can provide powerful insights into complex systems. These insights can help system designers better understand and improve the systems they develop (e.g., long-term behaviors of time series data), yet this is a very challenging and often intractable problem. This work presents a method for evaluating STL formulas using computation graphs, hence bridging a connection between STL and many modern machine learning frameworks that depend on computation graphs, such as deep learning. We show that this approach is particularly effective for solving parameteric STL (pSTL) problems, the problem of parameter fitting for a given signal. We provide a relaxation technique that makes this method more tractable when solving general pSTL formulas. By using computation graphs, we can leverage the benefits and the computational prowess of modern day machine learning tools. Motivated by the problem of learning explanatory factors and safety assurance for complex cyber-physical systems, we demonstrate our proposed method on an autonomous driving case study.},

  year         = {2021},
  abstract = {Advances in the fields of artificial intelligence and machine learning have unlocked a new generation of robotic systems---"learning-enabled" robots that are designed to operate in unstructured, uncertain, and unforgiving environments, especially settings where robots are required to interact in close proximity with humans. However, as learning-enabled methods, especially "deep" learning, continue to become more pervasive throughout the autonomy stack, it also becomes increasingly difficult to ascertain the performance and safety of these robotic systems and explain their behavior, necessary prerequisites for their deployment in safety-critical settings. This dissertation develops methods drawing upon techniques from the field of formal methods, namely Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability and Signal Temporal Logic (STL), to complement a learning-enabled robot autonomy stack, thereby leading to safer and more robust robot behavior. The first part of this dissertation investigates the problem of providing safety assurance for human-robot interactions, safety-critical settings wherein robots must reason about the uncertainty in human behavior to achieve seamless interactions with humans. Specifically, we develop a two-step approach where we first develop a learning-based human behavior prediction model tailored towards proactive robot planning and decision-making, which we then couple with a reachability-based safety controller that minimally intervenes whenever the robot is near safety violation. The approach is validated through human-in-the-loop simulation as well as on an experimental vehicle platform, demonstrating clear connections between theory and practice. The second part of this dissertation examines the use of STL as a formal language to incorporate logical reasoning into robot learning. In particular, we develop a technique, named STLCG, that casts STL into the same computational language as deep neural networks. Consequently, by using STLCG to express designers' domain expertise into a form compatible with neural networks, we can embed domain knowledge into learned components within the autonomy stack to provide additional levels of robustness and interpretability.},

  year         = {2021},
  abstract = {Cities worldwide struggle with overloaded transportation systems and their externalities, such as traffic congestion and emissions. The emerging autonomous transportation technology has a potential to alleviate these issues. At the same time, the decisions of profit-maximizing operators running large autonomous fleets could have a negative impact on other stakeholders, e.g., by disproportionately cannibalizing public transport, and therefore could make the transportation system even less efficient and sustainable. A careful analysis of these tradeoffs requires modeling the main modes of transportation, including public transport, within a unified framework. In this paper, we propose such a framework, which allows us to study the interplay among mobility service providers, public transport authorities, and customers. In particular, we analyze the effect of autonomous ride-hailing services on the demand for public transportation. Our framework combines a graph-theoretic network model for the transportation system with a game-theoretic market model in which mobility service providers are profit-maximizers, while customers select individually-optimal transportation options. We show how to reformulate the decision problem of each mobility service provider as a tractable second-order conic program. This allows us to compute equilibria via best response. Moreover, we show that the degenerate monopolistic case of a single mobility service provider can efficiently be solved as a quadratic program. We apply our framework to data for the city of Berlin, Germany, and present sensitivity analyses to study parameters that mobility service providers or municipalities can influence to steer the overall system. We show that depending on market conditions and policy restrictions, autonomous ride-hailing systems may complement or cannibalize a public transportation system, serving between 7 % and 80 % of all customers. We discuss the main factors behind differences in these outcomes as well as strategic design options available to policymakers. Among others, we show that the monopolistic and the competitive cases yield similar modal shares, but differ in the profit outcome of each mobility service provider.},

  abstract = {Value functions are powerful abstractions broadly used across optimal control and robotics algorithms. Several lines of work have attempted to leverage trajectory optimization to learn value function approximations, usually by solving a large number of trajectory optimization problems as a means to generate training data. Even though these methods point to a promising direction, for sufficiently complex tasks, their sampling requirements can become computationally intractable. In this work, we leverage insights from adversarial learning in order to improve the sampling efficiency of a simple value function learning algorithm. We demonstrate how generating adversarial samples for this task presents a unique challenge due to the loss function that does not admit a closed form expression of the samples, but that instead requires the solution to a nonlinear optimization problem. Our key insight is that by leveraging duality theory from optimization, it is still possible to compute adversarial samples for this learning problem with virtually no computational overhead, including without having to keep track of shifting distributions of approximation errors or having to train generative models. We apply our method, named SEAGuL, to a canonical control task (balancing the acrobot) and a more challenging and highly dynamic nonlinear control task (the perching of a small glider). We demonstrate that compared to random sampling, with the same number of samples, training value function approximations using SEAGuL leads to improved generalization errors that also translate to control performance improvement.},

In this paper, we combine sum-of-squares optimization and dynamic programming to address the reach-avoid problem, and provide a conservative solution that maintains reaching and avoidance guarantees. Our method is applicable to polynomial system dynamics and to general problem setups, and is more computationally scalable than previous related methods. Through a numerical example involving two single integrators, we validate our proposed theory and compare our method to Hamilton-Jacobi reachability.

The adaptive subspace can be efficiently generated by a correlated random matrix ensemble whose statistics mimic the input data. We prove that the improvement in the relative error of the solution can be tightly characterized in terms of the spectrum of the data matrix, and provide probabilistic upper-bounds. We then illustrate the consequences of our theory with data matrices of different spectral decay. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed approach offers significant speed ups in machine learning problems including logistic regression, kernel classification with random convolution layers and shallow neural networks with rectified linear units. Our analysis is based on convex analysis and Fenchel duality, and establishes connections to sketching and randomized matrix decomposition.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a novel risk-constrained multi-stage decision making approach to the architectural analysis of planetary rover missions. In particular, focusing on a 2018 Mars rover concept, which was considered as part of a potential Mars Sample Return campaign, we model the entry, descent, and landing (EDL) phase and the rover traverse phase as four sequential decision-making stages. The problem is to find a sequence of divert and driving maneuvers so that the rover drive is minimized and the probability of a mission failure (e.g., due to a failed landing) is below a user specified bound. By solving this problem for several different values of the model parameters (e.g., divert authority), this approach enables rigorous, accurate and systematic trade-offs for the EDL system vs. the mobility system, and, more in general, cross-domain trade-offs for the different phases of a space mission. The overall optimization problem can be seen as a chance-constrained dynamic programming problem, with the additional complexity that 1) in some stages the disturbances do not have any probabilistic characterization, and 2) the state space is extremely large (i.e, hundreds of millions of states for trade-offs with high-resolution Martian maps). To this purpose, we solve the problem by performing an unconventional combination of average and minimax cost analysis and by leveraging high efficient computation tools from the image processing community. Preliminary trade-off results are presented.},

  abstract = {The in-situ exploration of small Solar System bodies (such as asteroids or comets) is becoming a central objective for future planetary exploration. Such bodies are characterized by very weak gravitational fields, which make hopping mobility platforms one of the preferred mobility strategies for microgravity surface exploration, as recognized by space agencies worldwide. However, little is known about the dynamical behavior of hopping platforms in low gravity environments, where small bodies' rotational dynamics can have a critical effect. Accordingly, the objective of this paper is to study in detail the dynamic envelope of hopping microgravity rovers, with a focus on internal actuation. Specifically, we first perform a static analysis with the goal of determining regions of a small body where an internally-actuated hopping rover can stably remain at rest. Then, we perform a dynamic analysis and discuss the actuation and instrument pointing performance of hopping microgravity platforms as a function of a number of system and environmental parameters (e.g., rover shape, body rotation rate). Finally, we tailor our analysis to a potential mission to Mars' moon Phobos. Collectively, our results show that internally-actuated rovers, from an actuation standpoint, are a viable mobility solution for a vast class of small Solar System bodies. Also, our analysis represents a key first step to develop path planning algorithms for microgravity explorers to safely explore dynamically feasible regions.},

We formalize this problem using a graph to represent the environment, enforcing probabilistic survival constraints for each robot, and using a matroid (which generalizes linear independence to sets) to capture the team-based operational constraints. The resulting ?Matroid Team Surviving Orienteers? (MTSO) problem has broad applications for robotics such as informative path planning, resource delivery, and search and rescue. We demonstrate that the objective for the MTSO problem has submodular structure, which leads us to develop two polynomial time algorithms which are guaranteed to find a solution with value within a constant factor of the optimum. The second of our algorithms is an extension of the accelerated continuous greedy algorithm, and can be applied to much broader classes of constraints while maintaining bounds on suboptimality. In addition to in-depth analysis, we demonstrate the efficiency of our approaches by applying them to a scenario where a team of robots must gather information while avoiding dangers in the Coral Triangle and characterize scaling and parameter selection using a synthetic dataset.},

We present the TSO problem formally along with several variants, which represent "survivability-aware" counterparts for a wide range of multi-robot coordination problems such as vehicle routing, patrolling, and informative path planning. We propose an approximate greedy approach for selecting paths, and prove that the value of its output is bounded within a factor 1 - exp(-p_s/lambda) of the optimum where p_s is the per-robot survival probability threshold, and 1/lambda < 1 is the approximation factor of an oracle routine for the well-known orienteering problem. Our approach has linear time complexity in the team size and polynomial complexity in the graph size. Using numerical simulations, we verify that our approach is close to the optimum in practice and that it scales to problems with hundreds of nodes and tens of robots.},

A team operator seeks a set of paths for the smallest team which guarantee the probabilities that at least one robot visits each node satisfies specified per-node visit thresholds, and the probabilities each robot reaches its destination satisfy a per-robot survival threshold. We present the Risk-Sensitive Coverage (RSC) problem formally as an instance of the submodular set cover problem and propose an efficient cost-benefit greedy algorithm for finding a feasible set of paths. We prove that the number of robots deployed by our algorithm is no more than (lambda/p_s)(1+log( lambda Delta_K/p_s)) times the smallest team, where Delta_K quantifies the relative benefit of the first and last paths, p_s is the per-robot survival probability threshold and 1/lambda < 1 is the approximation factor of an oracle routine for the well-known orienteering problem. We demonstrate the quality of our solutions by comparing to optimal solutions computed for special cases of the RSC and the efficiency of our approach by applying it to a search and rescue scenario where 225 sites must be visited, each with probability at least 0.95.},

  abstract = {Robots are often designed for dangerous environments such as severe storms, but routing algorithms rarely are. This dissertation introduces a new class of routing problems with "risky traversal" where a robot may fail when travelling between two sites. Our key insight is that many objectives in the risky traversal model satisfy a diminishing returns property known as submodularity. We develop a set of tools based on submodular optimization which lead to efficient solutions for a wide variety of problems: (1) The "Team Surviving Orienteers" (TSO) problem, where the size of the team is fixed and we seek routes which maximize the expected rewards collected at nodes, subject to survival probability constraints on each robot. (2) The "On-line TSO" problem, where observations are incorporated to update the paths on-line in a parallel fashion (in response to survival events). (3) The "Heterogeneous TSO" problem, which allows robots to have different capabilities such as sensors (affecting rewards collected), actuation (affecting ability to traverse between sites), and robustness (affecting survival probabilities). (4) The "Matroid TSO" problem, where the set of routes must satisfy an "independence" constraint represented by a matroid, for example limits on the number of each type of robot available, traffic through regions of the environment, total risk budgets for the team, or combinations of these limits. (5) The "Risk Sensitive Coverage" problem, which is the dual to the TSO where the team must satisfy a coverage constraint (e.g., ensure that nodes are visited with specified probabilities) while using minimum resources (e.g., number of robots deployed, distance travelled, or expected number of failures). Our algorithms are based on the approximate greedy algorithm, where we iteratively select a path which approximately maximizes the expected incremental rewards subject to some constraints. Due to the submodular structure of the problems considered in this dissertation, we can prove bounds on the suboptimality of our algorithms. The approach developed in this dissertation provides a foundational set of tools for routing large scale teams in dangerous environments while explicitly planning for robot failure.},

  year         = {2015},
  abstract = {This article presents a novel approach, named MCMP (Monte Carlo Motion Planning), to the problem of motion planning under uncertainty, i.e., to the problem of computing a low-cost path that fulfills probabilistic collision avoidance constraints. MCMP estimates the collision probability (CP) of a given path by sampling via Monte Carlo the execution of a reference tracking controller (in this paper we consider LQG). The key algorithmic contribution of this paper is the design of statistical variance-reduction techniques, namely control variates and importance sampling, to make such a sampling procedure amenable to real-time implementation. MCMP applies this CP estimation procedure to motion planning by iteratively (i) computing an (approximately) optimal path for the deterministic version of the problem (here, using the FMT* algorithm), (ii) computing the CP of this path, and (iii) inflating or deflating the obstacles by a common factor depending on whether the CP is higher or lower than a target value. The advantages of MCMP are threefold: (i) asymptotic correctness of CP estimation, as opposed to most current approximations, which, as shown in this paper, can be off by large multiples and hinder the computation of feasible plans; (ii) speed and parallelizability, and (iii) generality, i.e., the approach is applicable to virtually any planning problem provided that a path tracking controller and a notion of distance to obstacles in the configuration space are available. Numerical results illustrate the correctness (in terms of feasibility), efficiency (in terms of path cost), and computational speed of MCMP},

Despite its ubiquitous nature, this formulation of motion planning has received relatively little theoretical investigation, as opposed to the setup where the environment is assumed known. A fundamental challenge is that, unlike motion planning with known obstacles, it is not even clear what an optimal policy to strive for is. Our contribution is threefold. First, we present a notion of optimality for safe planning in unknown environments in the spirit of comparative (as opposed to competitive) analysis, with the goal of obtaining a benchmark that is, at least conceptually, attainable. Second, by leveraging this theoretical benchmark, we derive a pseudooptimal class of policies that can seamlessly incorporate any amount of prior or learned information while still guaranteeing the robot never collides. Finally, we demonstrate the practicality of our algorithmic approach in numerical experiments using a range of environment types and dynamics, including a comparison with a state of the art method. A key aspect of our framework is that it automatically and implicitly weighs exploration versus exploitation in a way that is optimal with respect to the information available.},

  booktitle    = proc_WINE,
  year         = {2023},
  abstract = {Artificial currencies have grown in popularity in many real-world resource allocation settings. In particular, they have gained traction in government benefits programs, e.g., food assistance or transit benefits programs, that provide support to eligible users in the population, e.g., through subsidized food or public transit. However, such programs are prone to two common fraud mechanisms: (i) \emph{misreporting fraud}, wherein users can misreport their private attributes to gain access to more artificial currency (credits) than they are entitled to, and (ii) \emph{black market fraud}, wherein users may seek to sell some of their credits in exchange for \emph{real} money. In this work, we develop mechanisms to address these two sources of fraud in artificial currency based government benefits programs. To address misreporting fraud, we propose an audit mechanism that induces a two-stage game between an administrator and users, wherein the administrator running the benefits program can audit users at some cost and levy fines against them for misreporting their information. For this audit game, we first investigate the conditions on the administrator’s budget to establish the existence of equilibria and present a linear programming approach to compute these equilibria under both the signaling game and Bayesian persuasion formulations. We then show that the decrease in misreporting fraud corresponding to our audit mechanism far outweighs the spending of the administrator to run it by establishing that its total costs are lower than that of the status quo with no audits. To highlight the practical viability of our audit mechanism in mitigating misreporting fraud, we present a case study on Washington D.C.'s federal transit benefits program where the proposed audit mechanism even demonstrates several orders of magnitude improvement in total cost compared to a no-audit strategy for some parameter ranges.},

  abstract = {System optimum (SO) routing, wherein the total travel time of all users is minimized, is a holy grail for transportation authorities. However, SO routing may discriminate against users who incur much larger travel times than others to achieve high system efficiency, i.e., low total travel times. To address the inherent unfairness of SO routing, we study the $\beta$-fair SO problem whose goal is to minimize the total travel time while guaranteeing a $\beta\geq 1$ level of unfairness, which specifies the maximal ratio between the travel times of different users with shared origins and destinations. To obtain feasible solutions to the $\beta$-fair SO problem while achieving high system efficiency, we develop a new convex program, the Interpolated Traffic Assignment Problem (I-TAP), which interpolates between a fair and an efficient traffic-assignment objective. We then leverage the structure of I-TAP to develop two pricing mechanisms to collectively enforce the I-TAP solution in the presence of selfish homogeneous and heterogeneous users, respectively, that independently choose routes to minimize their own travel costs. We mention that this is the first study of pricing in the context of fair routing. Finally, we use origin-destination demand data for a range of transportation networks to numerically evaluate the performance of I-TAP as compared to a state-of-the-art algorithm. The numerical results indicate that our approach is faster by several orders of magnitude, while achieving higher system efficiency for most levels of unfairness.},

  booktitle    = proc_ACM_EAAMO,
  year         = {2021},
  abstract = {Congestion pricing has long been hailed as a means to mitigate traffic congestion; however, its practical adoption has been limited due to the resulting social inequity issue, e.g., low-income users are priced out off certain roads. This issue has spurred interest in the design of equitable mechanisms that aim to refund the collected toll revenues as lump-sum transfers to users. Although revenue refunding has been extensively studied for over three decades, there has been no thorough characterization of how such schemes can be designed to simultaneously achieve system efficiency and equity objectives. In this work, we bridge this gap through the study of congestion pricing and revenue refunding (CPRR) schemes in non-atomic congestion games. We first develop CPRR schemes, which in comparison to the untolled case, simultaneously (i) increase system efficiency and (ii) decrease wealth inequality, while being (iii) user-favorable: irrespective of their initial wealth or values-of-time (which may differ across users) users would experience a lower travel cost after the implementation of the proposed scheme. We then characterize the set of optimal user-favorable CPRR schemes that simultaneously maximize system efficiency and minimize wealth inequality. These results assume a well-studied behavior model of users minimizing a linear function of their travel times and tolls, without considering refunds. We also study a more complex behavior model wherein users are influenced by and react to the amount of refund that they receive. Although, in general, the two models can result in different outcomes in terms of system efficiency and wealth inequality, we establish that those outcomes coincide when the aforementioned optimal CPRR scheme is implemented. Overall, our work demonstrates that through appropriate refunding policies we can achieve system efficiency while reducing wealth inequality.},

  abstract = {Public goods are often either over-consumed in the absence of regulatory mechanisms, or remain completely unused, as in the Covid-19 pandemic, where social distance constraints are enforced to limit the number of people who can share public spaces. In this work, we plug this gap through market based mechanisms designed to efficiently allocate capacity constrained public goods. To design these mechanisms, we leverage the theory of Fisher markets, wherein each agent in the economy is endowed with an artificial currency budget that they can spend to avail public goods. While Fisher markets provide a strong methodological backbone to model resource allocation problems, their applicability is limited to settings involving two types of constraints - budgets of individual buyers and capacities of goods. Thus, we introduce a modified Fisher market, where each individual may have additional physical constraints, characterize its solution properties and establish the existence of a market equilibrium. Furthermore, to account for additional constraints we introduce a social convex optimization problem where we perturb the budgets of agents such that the KKT conditions of the perturbed social problem establishes equilibrium prices. Finally, to compute the budget perturbations we present a fixed point scheme and illustrate convergence guarantees through numerical experiments. Thus, our mechanism, both theoretically and computationally, overcomes a fundamental limitation of classical Fisher markets, which only consider capacity and budget constraints.},

  abstract = {Over the past decade, GPS enabled traffic applications, such as Google Maps andWaze, have become ubiquitous and have had a significant influence on billions of daily commuters? travel patterns. A consequence of the online route suggestions of such applications, e.g., via greedy routing, has often been an increase in traffic congestion since the induced travel patterns may be far from the system optimum routing pattern. Spurred by the widespread impact of navigational applications on travel patterns, this work studies online traffic routing in the context of capacity-constrained parallel road networks and analyzes this problem from two perspectives. First, we perform a worst-case analysis to identify the limits of deterministic online routing and show that the ratio between the online solution of any deterministic algorithm and the optimal offline solution is unbounded, even in simplistic settings. This result motivates us to move beyond worst-case analysis. Here, we consider algorithms that exploit knowledge of past problem instances and show how to design a data-driven algorithm whose performance can be quantified and formally generalized to unseen future instances. Finally, we present numerical experiments based on two application cases for the San Francisco Bay Area and evaluate the performance of our approach. Our results show that the data-driven algorithm often outperforms commonly used greedy online routing algorithms, in particular, in scenarios where the user types are heterogeneous and the network is congested.},

  year         = {2023},
  abstract = {Credit-based congestion pricing (CBCP) has emerged as a mechanism to alleviate the social inequity concerns of road congestion pricing - a promising strategy for traffic congestion mitigation - by providing low-income users with travel credits to offset some of their toll payments. While CBCP offers immense potential for addressing inequity issues that hamper the practical viability of congestion pricing, the deployment of CBCP in practice is nascent, and the potential efficacy and optimal design of CBCP schemes have yet to be formalized. In this work, we study the design of CBCP schemes to achieve particular societal objectives and investigate their influence on traffic patterns when routing heterogeneous users with different values of time (VoTs) in a multi-lane highway with an express lane. We introduce a new non-atomic congestion game model of a mixed-economy, wherein eligible users receive travel credits while the remaining ineligible users pay out-of-pocket to use the express lane. In this setting, we investigate the effect of CBCP schemes on traffic patterns by characterizing the properties (i.e., existence, comparative statics) of the corresponding Nash equilibria and, in the setting when eligible users have time-invariant VoTs, develop a convex program to compute these equilibria. We further present a bi-level optimization framework to design optimal CBCP schemes to achieve a central planner's societal objectives. Finally, we conduct numerical experiments based on a case study of the San Mateo 101 Express Lanes Project, one of the first North American CBCP pilots. Our results demonstrate the potential of CBCP to enable low-income travelers to avail of the travel time savings provided by congestion pricing on express lanes while having comparatively low impacts on the travel costs of other road users.},

  note         = {In Press},
  abstract = {In transportation networks, users typically choose routes in a decentralized and self-interested manner to minimize their individual travel costs, which, in practice, often results in inefficient overall outcomes for society. As a result, there has been a growing interest in designing road tolling schemes to cope with these efficiency losses and steer users toward a system-efficient traffic pattern. However, the efficacy of road tolling schemes often relies on having access to complete information on users' trip attributes, such as their origin-destination (O-D) travel information and their values of time, which may not be available in practice. Motivated by this practical consideration, we propose an online learning approach to set tolls in a traffic network to drive heterogeneous users with different values of time toward a system-efficient traffic pattern. In particular, we develop a simple yet effective algorithm that adjusts tolls at each time period solely based on the observed aggregate flows on the roads of the network without relying on any additional trip attributes of users, thereby preserving user privacy. In the setting where the O-D pairs and values of time of users are drawn i.i.d. at each period, we show that our approach obtains an expected regret and road capacity violation of $O(\sqrt{T})$, where $T$ is the number of periods over which tolls are updated. Our regret guarantee is relative to an offline oracle that has complete information on users' trip attributes. We further establish a $\Omega(\sqrt{T})$ lower bound on the regret of any algorithm, which establishes that our algorithm is optimal up to constants. Finally, we demonstrate the superior performance of our approach relative to several benchmarks on a real-world transportation network, thereby highlighting its practical applicability.},

A motivating example includes robots interacting with humans in crowded environments, such as self-driving cars operating alongside human-driven vehicles or human-robot collaborative bin packing in a warehouse. Our approach to model human behavior in such uncertain environments is to model humans in the scene as nodes in a graphical model, with edges encoding relationships between them. For each human, we learn a multimodal probability distribution over future actions from a dataset of multi-human interactions. Learning such distributions is made possible by recent advances in the theory of conditional variational autoencoders and deep learning approximations of probabilistic graphical models. Specifically, we learn action distributions conditioned on interaction history, neighboring human behavior, and candidate future agent behavior in order to take into account response dynamics. We demonstrate the performance of such a modeling approach in modeling basketball player trajectories, a highly multimodal, multi-human scenario which serves as a proxy for many robotic applications.},

Trajectory forecasting, in particular, is surrounded by uncertainty as its inputs are produced by (noisy) upstream perception and its outputs are predictions that are often probabilistic for use in downstream planning. However, most trajectory forecasting methods do not account for upstream uncertainty, instead taking only the most-likely values. As a result, perceptual uncertainties are not propagated through forecasting and predictions are frequently overconfident. To address this, we present a novel method for incorporating perceptual state uncertainty in trajectory forecasting, a key component of which is a new statistical distance-based loss function which encourages predicting uncertainties that better match upstream perception. We evaluate our approach both in illustrative simulations and on large-scale, real-world data, demonstrating its efficacy in propagating perceptual state uncertainty through prediction and producing more calibrated predictions.},

To exploit this information, we present HAICU, a method for heterogeneous-agent trajectory forecasting that explicitly incorporates agents' class probabilities. We additionally present PUP, a new challenging real-world autonomous driving dataset, to investigate the impact of Perceptual Uncertainty in Prediction. It contains challenging crowded scenes with unfiltered agent class probabilities that reflect the long-tail of current state-of-the-art perception systems. We demonstrate that incorporating class probabilities in trajectory forecasting significantly improves performance in the face of uncertainty, and enables new forecasting capabilities such as counterfactual predictions.},

  abstract = {Model-free Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers an attractive approach to learn control policies for high-dimensional systems, but its relatively poor sample complexity often forces training in simulated environments. Even in simulation, goal-directed tasks whose natural reward function is sparse remain intractable for state-of-the-art model-free algorithms for continuous control. The bottleneck in these tasks is the prohibitive amount of exploration required to obtain a learning signal from the initial state of the system. In this work, we leverage physical priors in the form of an approximate system dynamics model to design a curriculum scheme for a model-free policy optimization algorithm. Our Backward Reachability Curriculum (BaRC) begins policy training from states that require a small number of actions to accomplish the task, and expands the initial state distribution backwards in a dynamically-consistent manner once the policy optimization algorithm demonstrates sufficient performance. BaRC is general, in that it can accelerate training of any model-free RL algorithm on a broad class of goal-directed continuous control MDPs. Its curriculum strategy is physically intuitive, easy-to-tune, and allows incorporating physical priors to accelerate training without hindering the performance, flexibility, and applicability of the model-free RL algorithm. We evaluate our approach on two representative dynamic robotic learning problems and find substantial performance improvement relative to previous curriculum generation techniques and na{\"i}ve exploration strategies},

Towards this end, we propose Mixtures of Affine Time-varying Systems (MATS) as an output representation for trajectory forecasting that is more amenable to downstream planning and control use. Our approach leverages successful ideas from probabilistic trajectory forecasting works to learn dynamical system representations that are well-studied in the planning and control literature.

  abstract = {Autonomous systems are increasingly nearing widespread adoption, with new robotic platforms constantly being tested and deployed alongside humans in domains such as autonomous driving, service robotics, and surveillance. Accordingly, human-robot interaction will soon be present in many everyday scenarios. However, there are still many challenges preventing autonomous systems from safely and smoothly navigating interactions with humans. For example, while merging into traffic is one of the most common day-to-day maneuvers we perform as drivers, it poses a major problem for state-of-the-art self-driving vehicles. The reason humans can naturally navigate through many social interaction scenarios, such as merging in traffic, is that humans have an intrinsic capacity to reason about other people's intents, beliefs, and desires, applying this reasoning to predict what might happen in the future and make corresponding decisions. As a result, imbuing autonomous systems with the ability to reason about other agents' potential future actions is critical to enabling informed decision making and proactive actions to be taken in human-robot interaction scenarios. Indeed, the ability to predict other agents' behaviors (also known as "trajectory forecasting") has already become a core component of modern robotic systems, especially so in safety-critical applications such as autonomous vehicles. Towards this end, this dissertation tackles the development of trajectory forecasting methods, their effective integration within the robotic autonomy stack, and the injection of task-awareness in their performance evaluation.},

For instance, performing motion planning in a high-dimensional latent representation of the environment could be intractable. We consider the problem of sparsifying the discrete latent space of a trained conditional variational autoencoder, while preserving its learned multimodality. As a post hoc latent space reduction technique, we use evidential theory to identify the latent classes that receive direct evidence from a particular input condition and filter out those that do not. Experiments on diverse tasks, such as image generation and human behavior prediction, demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed technique at reducing the discrete latent sample space size of a model while maintaining its learned multimodality.},

  abstract = {The last decade saw the rapid development of two major mobility paradigms: Mobility-on-Demand (MoD) systems (e.g. ridesharing, carsharing) and self-driving vehicles. While individually impactful, together they present a major paradigm shift in modern mobility. Autonomous Mobility-on-Demand (AMoD) systems, wherein a fleet of self-driving vehicles serve on-demand travel requests, present a unique opportunity to alleviate many of our transportation woes. Specifically, by combining fully-compliant vehicles with central coordination, AMoD systems can achieve system-level optimal strategies via, e.g., coordinated routing and preemptive dispatch. This thesis presents methods to model, analyze and control AMoD systems. In particular, special emphasis is given to develop stochastic algorithms that can cope with the uncertainty inherent to travel demand. In the first part, we present a steady-state modeling framework built on queueing networks and network flow theory. By casting the system as a multi-class BCMP network, the framework provides analysis tools that allow the characterization of performance metrics for a given routing policy, in terms, e.g., of vehicle availabilities, and first and second order moments of vehicle throughput. Moreover, we present a scalable method for the synthesis of routing policies, with performance guarantees in the limit of large fleet sizes. The framework provides a large set of modeling options, and specifically address cases where the operational concerns of congestion and battery charge level are considered. We validate our theoretical results on a case study of New York City. In the second part, we leverage the insights provided by the steady-state models to present real-time control algorithms. Specifically, we cast the real-time control problem within a stochastic model predictive control framework. The control loop consists of a forecasting generative model and a stochastic optimization subproblem. At each time step, the generative model first forecasts a finite number of travel demand for a finite horizon and then we solve the stochastic subproblem via Sample Average Approximation. We show via simulation that this approach is more robust to uncertain demand and vastly outperforms state-of-the-art fleet-level control algorithms. Finally, we validate the presented frameworks by deploying a fleet control application in a carsharing system in Japan. The application uses the aforementioned algorithms to provide, in real-time, tasks to the carsharing employees regarding actions to be taken to better meet customer demand. Results show significant improvement over human based decision making.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a novel approach, named the Group Marching Tree (GMT*) algorithm, to planning on GPUs at rates amenable to application within control loops, allowing planning in real-world settings via repeated computation of near-optimal plans. GMT*, like the Fast Marching Tree (FMT*) algorithm, explores the state space with a ``lazy'' dynamic programming recursion on a set of samples to grow a tree of near-optimal paths. GMT*, however, alters the approach of FMT* with approximate dynamic programming by expanding, in parallel, the group of all active samples with cost below an increasing threshold, rather than only the minimum cost sample. This group approximation enables low-level parallelism over the sample set and removes the need for sequential data structures, while the ``lazy'' collision checking limits thread divergence---all contributing to a very efficient GPU implementation. While this approach incurs some suboptimality, we prove that GMT* remains asymptotically optimal up to a constant multiplicative factor. We show solutions for complex planning problems under differential constraints can be found in ~10 ms on a desktop GPU and ~30 ms on an embedded GPU, representing a significant speed up over the state of the art, with only small losses in performance. Finally, we present a scenario demonstrating the efficacy of planning within the control loop (~100 Hz) towards operating in dynamic, uncertain settings.},

  abstract = {In this paper we present the PUMP (Parallel Uncertainty-aware Multiobjective Planning) algorithm for addressing the stochastic kinodynamic motion planning problem, whereby we seek a low-cost, dynamically-feasible motion plan subject to a constraint on collision probability (CP). As a departure from previous methods for chance-constrained motion planning, PUMP directly considers both CP and the optimization objective at equal priority when planning through the free configuration space, achieving an unprecedented combination of cost performance, certified safety, and speed. Planning is conducted through a massively parallel multiobjective search, here implemented with a particular application focus on GPU hardware. PUMP explores the configuration space while maintaining a Pareto optimal front of motion plans, considering cost and approximate collision probability. We introduce a novel particle-based CP approximation scheme, designed for efficient GPU implementation, which accounts for dependencies over the history of a trajectory execution. Upon termination of the exploration phase, PUMP performs a search over the Pareto optimal set of solution motion plans to identify the lowest cost motion plan that is certified to satisfy the CP constraint (according to an asymptotically exact estimator). We present numerical experiments for quadrotor planning wherein PUMP identifies solutions in ~100 ms, evaluating over one hundred thousand partial plans through the course of its exploration phase. The results show that this multiobjective search achieves a lower motion plan cost, for the same collision probability constraint, compared to a safety buffer-based search heuristic and repeated RRT trials.},

  abstract = {This paper presents Latent Sampling-based Motion Planning (L-SBMP), a methodology towards computing motion plans for complex robotic systems by learning a plannable latent representation. Recent works in control of robotic systems have effectively leveraged local, low-dimensional embeddings of high-dimensional dynamics. In this paper we combine these recent advances with techniques from sampling-based motion planning (SBMP) in order to design a methodology capable of planning for high-dimensional robotic systems beyond the reach of traditional approaches (e.g., humanoids, or even systems where planning occurs in the visual space). Specifically, the learned latent space is constructed through an autoencoding network, a dynamics network, and a collision checking network, which mirror the three main algorithmic primitives of SBMP, namely state sampling, local steering, and collision checking. Notably, these networks can be trained through only raw data of the system's states and actions along with a supervising collision checker. Building upon these networks, an RRT-based algorithm is used to plan motions directly in the latent space - we refer to this exploration algorithm as Learned Latent RRT (L2RRT). This algorithm globally explores the latent space and is capable of generalizing to new environments. The overall methodology is demonstrated on two planning problems, namely a visual planning problem, whereby planning happens in the visual (pixel) space, and a humanoid robot planning problem.},

  abstract = {In this paper we approach the robust motion planning problem through the lens of perception-aware planning, whereby we seek a low-cost motion plan subject to a separate constraint on perception localization quality. To solve this problem we introduce the Multiobjective Perception-Aware Planning (MPAP) algorithm which explores the state space via a multiobjective search, considering both cost and a perception heuristic. This perception-heuristic formulation allows us to both capture the history dependence of localization drift and represent complex modern perception methods. The solution trajectory from this heuristic-based search is then certified via Monte Carlo methods to be robust. The additional computational burden of perception-aware planning is offset through massive parallelization on a GPU. Through numerical experiments the algorithm is shown to find robust solutions in about a second. Finally, we demonstrate MPAP on a quadrotor flying perception-aware and perception-agnostic plans using Google Tango for localization, finding the quadrotor safely executes the perception-aware plan every time, while crashing over 20% of the time on the perception-agnostic due to loss of localization.},

  year         = {2018},
  abstract = {A defining feature of sampling-based motion planning is the reliance on an implicit representation of the state space, which is enabled by a set of probing samples.Traditionally, these samples are drawn either probabilistically or deterministically to uniformly cover the state space. Yet, the motion of many robotic systems is often restricted to "small" regions of the state space, due to e.g. differential constraints or collision-avoidance constraints. To accelerate the planning process, it is thus desirable to devise non-uniform sampling strategies that favor sampling in those regions where an optimal solution might lie. This paper proposes a methodology for non-uniform sampling, whereby a sampling distribution is learnt from demonstrations, and then used to bias sampling. The sampling distribution is computed through a conditional variational autoencoder, allowing sample generation from the latent space conditioned on the specific planning problem. This methodology is general, can be used in combination with any sampling-based planner, and can effectively exploit the underlying structure of a planning problem while maintaining the theoretical guarantees of sampling-based approaches. Specifically, on several planning problems, the proposed methodology is shown to effectively learn representations for the relevant regions of the state space, resulting in an order of magnitude improvement in terms of success rate and convergence to the optimal cost},

  abstract = {Motion planning is a fundamental problem in robotics, whereby one seeks to compute a low-cost trajectory from an initial state to a goal region that avoids any obstacles. Sampling-based motion planning algorithms have emerged as an effective paradigm for planning with complex, high-dimensional robotic systems. These algorithms maintain only an implicit representation of the state space, constructed by sampling the free state space and locally connecting samples (under the supervision of a collision checking module). This thesis presents approaches towards enabling real-time and robust sampling-based motion planning with improved sampling strategies and massive parallelism. In the first part of this thesis, we discuss algorithms to leverage massively parallel hardware (GPUs) to accelerate planning and to consider robustness during the planning process. We present an algorithm capable of planning at rates amenable to application within control loops, ~10 ms. This algorithm uses approximate dynamic programming to explore the state space in a massively-parallel, near-optimal manner. We further present two algorithms capable of real-time, uncertainty-aware and perception-aware motion planning that exhaustively explore the state space via a multiobjective search. This search identifies a Pareto set of promising paths (in terms of cost and robustness) and certifies their robustness via Monte Carlo methods. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these algorithm in numerical simulations and a physical experiment on a quadrotor. In the second part of this thesis, we examine sampling-strategies for probing the state space; traditionally this has been uniform, independent, and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random points. We present a methodology for biasing the sample distribution towards regions of the state space in which the solution trajectory is likely to lie. This distribution is learned via a conditional variational autoencoder, allowing a general methodology, which can be used in combination with any samplingbased planner and can effectively exploit the underlying structure of a planning problem while maintaining the theoretical guarantees of sampling-based approaches. We also analyze the use of deterministic, low-dispersion samples instead of i.i.d. random points. We show that this allows deterministic asymptotic optimality (as opposed to probabilistic), a convergence rate bound in terms of the sample dispersion, reduced computational complexity, and improved practical performance. The technical approaches in this work are applicable to general robotic systems and lay the foundations of robustness and algorithmic speed required for robotic systems operating in the world.},

  abstract = {In this thesis, we investigate the mobility challenges associated with robotic exploration of small solar system bodies, such as comets and asteroids. We open with a discussion on the surface environment of small bodies, and in particular, how their extremely weak gravity motivates hopping as a promising form of locomotion for long-distance traverses. We then propose an adaptable rover architecture called ``Hedgehog''---a minimalistic, internally-actuated, hopping rover designed for targeted mobility in such low-gravity environments. By applying internal torques to three mutually-orthogonal flywheels, the rover's chassis rotates, giving rise to ground reaction forces and various motion primitives, including long-range hopping, short precise tumbling, and small pose adjustments. We propose various models for analyzing the dynamics of these motion primitives and derive control laws for achieving desired motions. We then discuss various methods for conducting experiments in a reduced-gravity environment, including a custom six-degree-of-freedom laboratory test bed and parabolic flights. We validate our control laws in these test beds and demonstrate unprecedented motion accuracy for internally-actuated hoppers. Finally, we broaden our focus to general hopping platforms and consider various algorithmic tools for autonomous exploration. Specifically, we develop a suite of tools for motion planning, localization, and traversability analysis, with a careful attention on the various sources of model uncertainty and the complex dynamics of hopping trajectories. Despite the stochastic nature of bouncing dynamics, we demonstrate through high-fidelity simulations that a hopping rover can efficiently traverse highly irregular bodies that would otherwise be inaccessible to traditional rovers.},

  abstract = {The localization of landers on the surface of small bodies has traditionally relied on observations from a mothership (e.g. Rosetta's Philae lander and Hayabusa 2's MASCOT and MINERVA landers). However, when line-of-sight with the mothership is not always available, or for surface rovers that travel large distances, alternative mothership-independent localization techniques may be required. On-board vision-based techniques have demonstrated effective localization in terrestrial applications as well as for Mars rovers, but may be unreliable on small bodies where rovers must contend with fast-moving shadows, difficulties observing absolute scale, and issues acquiring images such as dust, sun blinding, tumbling and low albedo. We investigate the feasibility of an entirely new localization approach based on surface gravimetry, where a rover can constrain its location on the surface by precisely measuring the local gravity vector. This mothership-independent localization technique is well-suited to a class of hybrid rovers that can bounce and tumble over the surface of small bodies; it is insensitive to surface illumination, and even works at night. We develop a Bayesian framework for computing localization ``likelihood maps'' from gravimetry (and gradiometry) data, accounting for all sensor and model uncertainties. We then propose a method for deriving landing distributions of a bouncing rover from simulation data to serve as a prior for the localization estimate. Finally, we conduct a case study on the Philae lander, where we show how this approach could have helped reject localization hypotheses and significantly narrow the areas searched for the Philae lander.},

However, hopping dynamics are governed by nonlinear gravity fields and stochastic bouncing on highly irregular surfaces, which pose several challenges for traditional motion planning methods. This paper presents the first ever discussion of motion planning for hopping rovers that explicitly accounts for various sources of uncertainty. We first address the problem of planning a single hopping trajectory by developing (1) an algorithm for robustly solving Lambert's orbital boundary value problems in irregular gravity fields, and (2) a method for computing landing distributions by propagating control and model uncertainties---from which, a time/energy-optimal hop can be selected using a (myopic) policy gradient. We then cast the sequential planning problem as a Markov decision process and apply a sample-efficient, off-line, off-policy reinforcement learning algorithm---namely, a variant of least squares policy iteration (LSPI)---to derive approximately optimal control policies that are safe, efficient, and amenable to real-time implementation on computationally-constrained rover hardware. These policies are demonstrated in simulation to be robust to modelling errors and outperform previous heuristics.},

  abstract = {Gaussian Process (GP) regression has seen widespread use in robotics due to its generality, simplicity of use, and the utility of Bayesian predictions. In particular, the predominant implementation of GP regression is kernel-based, as it enables fitting of arbitrary nonlinear functions by leveraging kernel functions as infinite-dimensional features. While incorporating prior information has the potential to drastically improve data efficiency of kernel-based GP regression, expressing complex priors through the choice of kernel function and associated hyperparameters is often challenging and unintuitive. Furthermore, the computational complexity of kernel-based GP regression scales poorly with the number of samples, limiting its application in regimes where a large amount of data is available. In this work, we propose ALPaCA, an algorithm for efficient Bayesian regression which addresses these issues. ALPaCA uses a dataset of sample functions to learn a domain-specific, finite-dimensional feature encoding, as well as a prior over the associated weights, such that Bayesian linear regression in this feature space yields accurate online predictions of the posterior density. These features are neural networks, which are trained via a meta-learning approach. ALPaCA extracts all prior information from the dataset, rather than relying on the choice of arbitrary, restrictive kernel hyperparameters. Furthermore, it substantially reduces sample complexity, and allows scaling to large systems. We investigate the performance of ALPaCA on two simple regression problems, two simulated robotic systems, and on a lane-change driving task performed by humans. We find our approach outperforms kernel-based GP regression, as well as state of the art meta-learning approaches, thereby providing a promising plug-in tool for many regression tasks in robotics where scalability and data-efficiency are important.},

  abstract = {Model-free policy learning has enabled robust performance of complex tasks with relatively simple algorithms. However, this simplicity comes at the cost of requiring an Oracle and arguably very poor sample complexity. This renders such methods unsuitable for physical systems. Variants of model-based methods address this problem through the use of simulators, however, this gives rise to the problem of policy transfer from simulated to the physical system. Model mismatch due to systematic parameter shift and unmodelled dynamics error may cause suboptimal or unsafe behavior upon direct transfer. We introduce the Adaptive Policy Transfer for Stochastic Dynamics (ADAPT) algorithm that achieves provably safe and robust, dynamically-feasible zero-shot transfer of RL-policies to new domains with dynamics error. ADAPT combines the strengths of offline policy learning in a black-box source simulator with online tube-based MPC to attenuate bounded model mismatch between the source and target dynamics. ADAPT allows online transfer of policy, trained solely in a simulation offline, to a family of unknown targets without fine-tuning. We also formally show that (i) ADAPT guarantees state and control safety through state-action tubes under the assumption of Lipschitz continuity of the divergence in dynamics and, (ii) ADAPT results in a bounded loss of reward accumulation in case of direct transfer with ADAPT as compared to a policy trained only on target. We evaluate ADAPT on 2 continuous, non-holonomic simulated dynamical systems with 4 different disturbance models, and find that ADAPT performs between 50\%-300\% better on mean reward accrual than direct policy transfer.},

  abstract = {Autonomous robots have the potential to free humans from dangerous or dull work. To achieve truly autonomous operation, robots must be able to understand unstructured environments and make safe decisions in the face of uncertainty and non-stationarity. As such, robots must be able to learn about, and react to, changing operating conditions or environments continuously, efficiently, and safely. While the last decade has seen rapid advances in the capabilities of machine learning systems driven by deep learning, these systems are limited in their ability to adapt online, learn with small amounts of data, and characterize uncertainty. The desiderata of learning robots therefore directly conflict with the weaknesses of modern deep learning systems. This thesis aims to remedy this conflict and develop robot learning systems that are capable of learning safely and efficiently. In the first part of the thesis we develop tools for efficient learning in changing environments. In particular, we develop tools for the meta-learning problem setting---in which data from a collection of environments may be used to accelerate learning in a new environment---in both the regression and classification setting. These algorithms are based on exact Bayesian inference on meta-learned features. This approach enables characterization of uncertainty in the face of small amounts of within-environment data, and efficient learning via exact conditioning. We extend these approaches to time-varying settings beyond episodic variation, including continuous gradual environmental variation and sharp, changepoint-like variation. In the second part of the thesis we adapt these tools to the problem of robot modeling and control. In particular, we investigate the problem of combining our neural network-based meta-learning models with prior knowledge in the form of a nominal dynamics model, and discuss design decisions to yield better performance and parameter identification. We then develop a strategy for safe learning control. This strategy combines methods from modern constrained control---in particular, robust model predictive control---with ideas from classical adaptive control to yield a computationally efficient, simple to implement, and guaranteed safe control strategy capable of learning online. We conclude the thesis with a discussion of short, intermediate, and long-term next steps in extending the ideas developed herein toward the goal of true robot autonomy.},

  abstract = {During the last decade, tensegrity systems have been the focus of numerous investigations exploring the possibility of adopting them for planetary landing and exploration applications. Early approaches mainly focused on locomotion aspects related to tensegrity systems, where mobility was achieved by actuating the cable members of the system. Later efforts focused on understanding energy storage mechanisms of tensegrity systems undergoing landing events. More precisely, it was shown that under highly dynamic events, buckling of individual members of a tensegrity structure does not necessarily imply structural failure, suggesting that efficient structural design of planetary landers could be achieved by allowing its compression members to buckle. In this work, we combine both aspects of previous research on tensegrity structures, showing a possible lattice-like structural configuration able to withstand impact events, store pre-impact kinetic energy, and utilize a part of that energy for the locomotion process. Our work shows the feasibility of this proposed approach via both experimental and computational means.},

  year         = {2021},
  abstract = {Autonomous mobility-on-demand (AMoD) systems represent a rapidly developing mode of transportation wherein travel requests are dynamically handled by a coordinated fleet of robotic, self-driving vehicles. Given a graph representation of the transportation network - one where, for example, nodes represent areas of the city, and edges the connectivity between them - we argue that the AMoD control problem is naturally cast as a node-wise decision-making problem. In this paper, we propose a deep reinforcement learning framework to control the rebalancing of AMoD systems through graph neural networks. Crucially, we demonstrate that graph neural networks enable reinforcement learning agents to recover behavior policies that are significantly more transferable, generalizable, and scalable than policies learned through other approaches. Empirically, we show how the learned policies exhibit promising zero-shot transfer capabilities when faced with critical portability tasks such as inter-city generalization, service area expansion, and adaptation to potentially complex urban topologies.},

  abstract = {Autonomous Mobility-on-Demand (AMoD) systems represent an attractive alternative to existing transportation paradigms, currently challenged by urbanization and increasing travel needs. By centrally controlling a fleet of self-driving vehicles, these systems provide mobility service to customers and are currently starting to be deployed in a number of cities around the world. Current learning-based approaches for controlling AMoD systems are limited to the \emph{single-city} scenario, whereby the service operator is allowed to take an unlimited amount of operational decisions within the same transportation system. However, real-world system operators can hardly afford to fully re-train AMoD controllers for every city they operate in, as this could result in a high number of poor-quality decisions during training, making the single-city strategy a potentially impractical solution. To address these limitations, we propose to formalize the multi-city AMoD problem through the lens of meta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) and devise an actor-critic algorithm based on recurrent graph neural networks. In our approach, AMoD controllers are explicitly trained such that a small amount of experience within a new city will produce good system performance. Empirically, we show how control policies learned through meta-RL are able to achieve near-optimal performance on unseen cities by learning rapidly adaptable policies, thus making them more robust not only to novel environments, but also to distribution shifts common in real-world operations, such as special events, unexpected congestion, and dynamic pricing schemes.},

Control policies depend on several factors, including the definition of the tasks, of the task generation process, of the vehicle dynamics and constraints, of the information available to the vehicles, and of the performance objective. Ensuring the stability of the system, i.e., the uniform boundedness of the number of outstanding tasks, is a primary concern. Typical performance objectives include measures of quality of service, such as, e.g., the average or worst-case time a task spends in the system before being completed, or the percentage of tasks that are completed before certain deadlines. The scalability of the control policies to large groups of vehicles often drives the choice of the information structure, requiring distributed computation},

In this paper, we show that these challenges can be significantly attenuated if the PDNs' operational constraints and exogenous loads (e.g., from homes or businesses) are accounted for when operating an electric AMoD fleet. We focus on a system-level perspective, assuming full coordination between the AMoD and the PDN operators. From this single entity perspective, we assess potential coordination benefits. Specifically, we extend previous results on an optimization-based modeling approach for electric AMoD systems to jointly control an electric AMoD fleet and a series of PDNs, and analyze the benefit of coordination under load balancing constraints. For a case study of Orange County, CA, we show that the coordination between the electric AMoD fleet and the PDNs eliminates 99% of the overloads and 50% of the voltage drops that the electric AMoD fleet would cause in an uncoordinated setting. Our results show that coordinating electric AMoD and PDNs can help maintain the reliability of PDNs under added electric AMoD charging load, thus significantly mitigating or deferring the need for PDN capacity upgrades.},

This chapter surveys algorithms on task assignment and scheduling for one or multiple UAVs in a dynamic environment, in which targets arrive at random locations at random times, and remain active until one of the UAVs flies to the target's location and performs an on-site task. The objective is to minimize some measure of the targets' activity, e.g., the average amount of time during which a target remains active. The chapter focuses on a technical approach that relies upon methods from queueing theory, combinatorial optimization, and stochastic geometry. The main advantage of this approach is its ability to provide analytical estimates of the performance of the UAV system on a given problem, thus providing insight into how performance is affected by design and environmental parameters, such as the number of UAVs and the target distribution. In addition, the approach provides provable guarantees on the system's performance with respect to an ideal optimum. To illustrate this approach, a variety of scenarios are considered, ranging from the simplest case where one UAV moves along continuous paths and has unlimited sensing capabilities, to the case where the motion of the UAV is subject to curvature constraints, and finally to the case where the UAV has a finite sensor footprint. Finally, the problem of cooperative routing algorithms for multiple UAVs is considered, within the same queueing-theoretical framework, and with a focus on control decentralization.},

We propose a data-driven method for predicting the map of the unobserved environment, using the robot's observations of its surroundings as context. These map predictions are then used to plan trajectories from the robot's position to the goal without requiring frontier selection. We demonstrate that our map-predictive motion planning strategy yields a substantial improvement in trajectory time over a naive frontier pursuit method and demonstrates similar performance to methods using more sophisticated frontier selection heuristics with significantly shorter computation time.},

  abstract = {In this work we derive a second-order approach to bilevel optimization, a type of mathematical programming in which the solution to a parameterized optimization problem (the ``lower'' problem) is itself to be optimized (in the ``upper'' problem) as a function of the parameters. Many existing approaches to bilevel optimization employ first-order sensitivity analysis, based on the implicit function theorem (IFT), for the lower problem to derive a gradient of the lower problem solution with respect to its parameters; this IFT gradient is then used in a first-order optimization method for the upper problem. This paper extends this sensitivity analysis to provide second-order derivative information of the lower problem (which we call the IFT Hessian), enabling the usage of faster-converging second-order optimization methods at the upper level.  Our analysis shows that (i) much of the computation already used to produce the IFT gradient can be reused for the IFT Hessian, (ii) errors bounds derived for the IFT gradient readily apply to the IFT Hessian, (iii) computing IFT Hessians can significantly reduce overall computation by extracting more information from each lower level solve. We corroborate our findings and demonstrate the broad range of applications of our method by applying it to problem instances of least squares hyperparameter auto-tuning, multi-class SVM auto-tuning, and inverse optimal control.},

Our approach builds on scenario methods for MPC, but in contrast to existing approaches, which either constrain all or only the first timestep to share actions across scenarios, we investigate the impact of a partial consensus horizon. Implementing this optimization for nonlinear dynamics by leveraging sequential convex optimization, our approach yields an efficient framework that can be tuned to the particular information gain dynamics of a system to mitigate both over-conservatism and over-optimism. We investigate our approach for two robotic systems across three problem settings: time-varying, partially observed dynamics; sensing uncertainty; and model-based reinforcement learning, and show that our approach improves performance over baselines in all settings.},

  abstract = {An underlying structure in several sampling-based methods for continuous multi-robot motion planning (MRMP) is the tensor roadmap (TR), which emerges from combining multiple PRM graphs constructed for the individual robots via a tensor product. We study the conditions under which the TR encodes a near-optimal solution for MRMP---satisfying these conditions implies near optimality for a variety of popular planners, including dRRT*, and the discrete methods M* and CBS when applied to the continuous domain. We develop the first finite-sample analysis of this kind, which specifies the number of samples, their deterministic distribution, and magnitude of the connection radii that should be used by each individual PRM graph, to guarantee near-optimality using the TR. This significantly improves upon a previous asymptotic analysis, wherein the number of samples tends to infinity, and supports guaranteed high-quality solutions in practice, within bounded running time. To achieve our new result, we first develop a sampling scheme, which we call the staggered grid, for finite-sample motion planning for individual robots, which requires significantly less samples than previous work. We then extend it to the much more involved MRMP setting which requires to account for interactions among multiple robots. Finally, we report on a few experiments that serve as a verification of our theoretical findings and raise interesting questions for further investigation.},

  abstract = {Deep learning has had a far reaching impact in robotics. Specifically, deep reinforcement learning algorithms have been highly effective in synthesizing neural-network controllers for a wide range of tasks. However, despite this empirical success, these controllers still lack theoretical guarantees on their performance, such as Lyapunov stability (i.e., all trajectories of the closed-loop system are guaranteed to converge to a goal state under the control policy). This is in stark contrast to traditional model based controller design, where principled approaches (like LQR) can synthesize stable controllers with provable guarantees. To address this gap, we propose a generic method to synthesize a Lyapunov-stable neural-network controller, together with a neural-network Lyapunov function to simultaneously certify its stability. Our approach formulates the Lyapunov condition verification as a mixed-integer linear program (MIP). Our MIP verifier either certifies the Lyapunov condition, or generates counter-examples that can help improve the candidate controller and the Lyapunov function. We also present an optimization program to compute an inner approximation of the region-of-attraction for the closed-loop system. We apply our approach to robots including an inverted pendulum, a 2D and a 3D quadrotor, and showcase that our neural-network controller outperforms a baseline LQR controller.},

  abstract = {We introduce an algorithm for synthesizing and verifying piecewise linear Lyapunov functions to prove global exponential stability of piecewise linear dynamical systems. The Lyapunov functions we synthesize are parameterized by feedforward neural networks with leaky ReLU activation units. To train these neural networks, we design a loss function that measures the maximal violation of the Lyapunov conditions in the state space. We show that this maximal violation can be computed by solving a mixed-integer linear program (MILP). Compared to previous learning-based approaches, our learning approach is able to certify with high precision that the learned neural network satisfies the Lyapunov conditions not only for sampled states, but over the entire state space. Moreover, compared to previous optimization-based approaches that require a pre-specified partition of the state space when synthesizing piecewise Lyapunov functions, our method can automatically search for both the partition and the Lyapunov function simultaneously. We demonstrate our algorithm on both continuous and discrete-time systems, including some for which known strategies for partitioning of the Lyapunov function would require introducing higher order Lyapunov functions.},

  abstract = {In this paper we address the problem of decision making within a Markov decision process (MDP) framework where risk and modeling errors are taken into account. Our approach is to minimize a risk-sensitive conditional-value-at-risk (CVaR) objective, as opposed to a standard risk-neutral expectation. We refer to such problem as CVaR MDP. Our first contribution is to show that a CVaR objective, besides capturing risk sensitivity, has an alternative interpretation as expected cost under worst-case modeling errors, for a given error budget. This result, which is of independent interest, motivates CVaR MDPs as a unifying framework for risk-sensitive and robust decision making. Our second contribution is to present a value-iteration algorithm for CVaR MDPs, and analyze its convergence rate. To our knowledge, this is the first solution algorithm for CVaR MDPs that enjoys error guarantees. Finally, we present results from numerical experiments that corroborate our theoretical findings and show the practicality of our approach.},

  abstract = {In this paper we present a dynamic programing approach to stochastic optimal control problems with dynamic, time-consistent risk constraints. Constrained stochastic optimal control problems, which naturally arise when one has to consider multiple objectives, have been extensively investigated in the past 20 years; however, in most formulations, the constraints are formulated as either risk-neutral (i.e., by considering an expected cost), or by applying static, singleperiod risk metrics with limited attention to "time-consistency" (i.e., to whether such metrics ensure rational consistency of risk preferences across multiple periods). Recently, significant strides have been made in the development of a rigorous theory of dynamic, time-consistent risk metrics for multi-period (risk-sensitive) decision processes; however, their integration within constrained stochastic optimal control problems has received little attention. The goal of this paper is to bridge this gap. First, we formulate the stochastic optimal control problem with dynamic, time-consistent risk constraints and we characterize the tail subproblems (which requires the addition of a Markovian structure to the risk metrics). Second, we develop a dynamic programming approach for its solution, which allows to compute the optimal costs by value iteration. Finally, we discuss both theoretical and practical features of our approach, such as generalizations, construction of optimal control policies, and computational aspects. A simple, two-state example is given to illustrate the problem setup and the solution approach.},

However, even if both the state space and action spaces for the original optimization problem are finite, the augmented state in the induced MDP problem contains state variables that are continuous. Our approach is to apply a uniform-grid discretization scheme for the augmented state. To prove the correctness of this approach, we develop novel Lipschitz bounds for constrained dynamic programming operators. We show that convergence to the optimal value functions is linear in the step size, which is the same convergence rate for discretization algorithms for unconstrained dynamic programming operators.

We collectively refer to such problems as percentile risk-constrained MDPs. Specifically, we first derive a formula for computing the gradient of the Lagrangian function for percentile risk-constrained MDPs. Then, we devise policy gradient and actor-critic algorithms that (1) estimate such gradient, (2) update the policy parameters in the descent direction, and (3) update the Lagrange multiplier in the ascent direction. For these algorithms we prove convergence to locally-optimal policies. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms in an optimal stopping problem and an online marketing application.},

  year         = {2017},
  abstract = {Markov decision processes (MDPs) provide a mathematical framework for modeling sequential decision making where system evolution and cost/reward depend on uncertainties and control actions of a decision. MDP models have been widely adopted in numerous domains such as robotics, control systems, finance, economics, and manufacturing. At the same time, optimization theories of MDPs serve as the theoretical underpinnings to numerous dynamic programming and reinforcement learning algorithms in stochastic control problems. While the study in MDPs is attractive for several reasons, there are two main challenges associated with its practicality: (1) An accurate MDP model is oftentimes not available to the decision maker. Affected by modeling errors, the resultant MDP solution policy is non-robust to system fluctuations. (2) The most widely-adopted optimization criterion for MDPs is represented by the risk-neutral expectation of a cumulative cost. This does not take into account the notion of risk, i.e., increased awareness of events of small probability but high consequences. In this thesis we study multiple important aspects in risk-sensitive sequential decision making where the variability of stochastic costs and robustness to modeling errors are taken into account. First, we address a special type of risk-sensitive decision making problems where the percentile behaviors are considered. Here risk is either modeled by the conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) or the Value-at-risk (VaR). VaR measures risk as the maximum cost that might be incurred with respect to a given confidence level, and is appealing due to its intuitive meaning and its connection to chance-constraints. The VaR risk measure has many fundamental engineering applications such as motion planning, where a safety constraint is imposed to upper bound the probability of maneuvering into dangerous regimes. Despite its popularity, VaR suffers from being unstable, and its singularity often introduces mathematical issues to optimization problems. To alleviate this problem, an alternative measure that addresses most of VaR?s shortcomings is CVaR. CVaR is a risk-measure that is rapidly gaining popularity in various financial applications, due to its favorable computational properties (i.e., CVaR is a coherent risk) and superior ability to safeguard a decision maker from the "outcomes that hurt the most". As a risk that measures the conditional expected cost given that such cost is greater than or equal to VaR, CVaR accounts for the total cost of undesirable events (it corresponds to events whose associated probability is low, but the corresponding cost is high) and is therefore preferable in financial application ssuch as portfolio optimization. Second, we consider optimization problems in which the objective function involves a coherent risk measure of the random cost. Here the term coherent risk [7] denotes a general class of risks that satisfies convexity, monotonicity, translational-invariance and positive homogeneity. These properties not only guarantee that the optimization problems are mathematically well-posed, but they are also axiomatically justified. Therefore modeling risk-aversion with coherent risks has already gained widespread acceptance in engineering, finance and operations research applications, among others. On the other hand, when the optimization problem is sequential, another important property of a risk measure is time consistency. A time consistent risk metric satisfies the "dynamic-programming" style property which ensures rational decision making, i.e., the strategy that is risk-optimal at the current stage will also be deemed optimal in subsequent stages. To get the best of both worlds, the recently proposed Markov risk measures [119] satisfy both the coherent risk properties and time consistency. Thus to ensure rationality in risk modeling and algorithmic tractability, this thesis will focus on risk-sensitive sequential decision making problems modeled by Markov risk measures.},

  abstract = {We address the problem of routing a team of drones and trucks over large-scale urban road networks. To conserve their limited flight energy, drones can use trucks as temporary modes of transit en route to their own destinations. Such coordination can yield significant savings in total vehicle distance traveled, i.e., truck travel distance and drone flight distance, compared to operating drones and trucks independently. But it comes at the potentially prohibitive computational cost of deciding which trucks and drones should coordinate and when and where it is most beneficial to do so. We tackle this fundamental trade-off by decoupling our overall intractable problem into tractable sub-problems that we solve stage-wise. The first stage solves only for trucks, by computing paths that make them more likely to be useful transit options for drones. The second stage solves only for drones, by routing them over a composite of the road network and the transit network defined by truck paths from the first stage. We design a comprehensive algorithmic framework that frames each stage as a multi-agent path finding problem and implement two distinct methods for solving them. We evaluate our approach on extensive simulations with up to $100$ agents on the real-world Manhattan road network containing nearly $4500$ vertices and $10000$ edges. Our framework saves on more than $50\%$ of vehicle distance traveled compared to independently solving for trucks and drones, and computes solutions for all settings within $5$ minutes on commodity hardware.},

  abstract = {We present a collaborative visual localization method for rovers designed to hop and tumble over the surface of small Solar System bodies, such as comets and asteroids. In a two-phase approach, an orbiting primary spacecraft first maps the surface of a body by capturing images from various poses and illumination angles; these images are processed to create a prior map of 3D landmarks. In the second phase, a hopping rover is deployed to the surface where it uses the prior map and a camera to perform on-board visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). Small bodies present new challenges to existing visual SLAM algorithms. Rotation periods as short as 1-12 hours, in the absence of atmospheric scattering, create high-contrast shadows that move over the surface. The constantly changing illumination angles cause landmark outliers and increase pose uncertainty. Furthermore, in this collaborative visual SLAM problem, the scene scale between spacecraft and hopping rover varies by several orders of magnitude (kilometers to centimeters). In this work, we describe how to augment ORB-SLAM2 - a state of the art visual SLAM implementation - so that it combines prior images with multiple illumination angles to handle large illumination variations. We also demonstrate how a wide field of view (FOV) camera (e.g. on a hopping rover) can relocalize to prior maps captured by a narrow FOV camera (e.g. a spacecraft navcam) to handle large scale variations. To reduce pose and scale errors accumulated while exploring the surface, we show how the rover can perform large hops to capture views of the surface that it can match to the prior map. After relocalizing, the rover's on-board estimates are updated with a pose graph optimization and bundle adjustment. We evaluate the proposed method with sequences of images captured around a mock asteroid; illumination angles are varied while narrow and wide FOV cameras are steered along trajectories representative of orbital and hopping motions. Trajectory estimates are compared and found to be consistent with ground truth data. Evaluations suggest this method is robust to large illumination variations, scene scale changes and off-nadir camera pointing angles.},

In particular, we consider the problem of how a robot could select its actions so as to maximally disambiguate between different model hypotheses that govern the environment it operates in or its interaction with other agents whose prime motivation is a priori unknown. The identification problem is posed as selection of the most likely model from a set of candidates, where each candidate is an adversarial Markov decision process (MDP) together with a linear temporal logic (LTL) formula that constrains robot-environment interaction. An adversarial MDP is an MDP in which transitions depend on both a (controlled) robot action and an (uncontrolled) adversary action. States are labeled, thus allowing interpretation of satisfaction of LTL formulae, which have a special form admitting satisfaction decisions in bounded time. An example where a robotic car must discern whether neighboring vehicles are following its trajectory for a surveillance operation is used to illustrate the problem and demonstrate our approach.},

However, resource-constrained robots, like low-power drones, often have insufficient on-board compute resources or power reserves to scalably run the most accurate, state-of-the art neural network compute models. Cloud robotics allows mobile robots the benefit of offloading compute to centralized servers if they are uncertain locally or want to run more accurate, compute-intensive models. However, cloud robotics comes with a key, often understated cost: communicating with the cloud over congested wireless networks may result in latency or loss of data. In fact, sending high data-rate video or LIDAR from multiple robots over congested networks can lead to prohibitive delay for real-time applications, which we measure experimentally. In this paper, we formulate a novel Robot Offloading Problem - how and when should robots offload sensing tasks, especially if they are uncertain, to improve accuracy while minimizing the cost of cloud communication? We formulate offloading as a sequential decision making problem for robots, and propose a solution using deep reinforcement learning. In both simulations and hardware experiments using state-of-the art vision DNNs, our offloading strategy improves vision task performance by between 1.3-2.6x of benchmark offloading strategies, allowing robots the potential to significantly transcend their on-board sensing accuracy but with limited cost of cloud communication.},

  abstract = {Today's robotic fleets are increasingly measuring high-volume video and LIDAR sensory streams, which can be mined for valuable training data, such as rare scenes of road construction sites, to steadily improve robotic perception models. However, re-training perception models on growing volumes of rich sensory data in central compute servers (or the "cloud") places an enormous time and cost burden on network transfer, cloud storage, human annotation, and cloud computing resources. Hence, we introduce HarvestNet, an intelligent sampling algorithm that resides on-board a robot and reduces system bottlenecks by only storing rare, useful events to steadily improve perception models re-trained in the cloud. HarvestNet significantly improves the accuracy of machine-learning models on our novel dataset of road construction sites, field testing of self-driving cars, and streaming face recognition, while reducing cloud storage, dataset annotation time, and cloud compute time by between 65.7-81.3%. Further, it is between 1.05-2.58x more accurate than baseline algorithms and scalably runs on embedded deep learning hardware.},

  abstract = {Modern mobile networks are facing unprecedented growth in demand due to a new class of traffic from Internet of Things (IoT) devices such as smart wearables and autonomous cars. Future networks must schedule delay-tolerant software updates, data backup, and other transfers from IoT devices while maintaining strict service guarantees for conventional real-time applications such as voice-calling and video. This problem is extremely challenging because conventional traffic is highly dynamic across space and time, so its performance is significantly impacted if all IoT traffic is scheduled immediately when it originates. In this paper, we present a reinforcement learning (RL) based scheduler that can dynamically adapt to traffic variation, and to various reward functions set by network operators, to optimally schedule IoT traffic. Using 4 weeks of real network data from downtown Melbourne, Australia spanning diverse traffic patterns, we demonstrate that our RL scheduler can enable mobile networks to carry 14.7% more data with minimal impact on existing traffic, and outperforms heuristic schedulers by more than 2x. Our work is a valuable step towards designing autonomous, "self- driving" networks that learn to manage themselves from past data.},

This paper presents a solution to learn succinct, highly-compressed forecasts that are co-designed with a modular controller's task objective. Our simulations with real cellular, Internet-of-Things (IoT), and electricity load data show we can improve a model predictive controller's performance by at least 25\% while transmitting 80\% less data than the competing method.

  year         = {2018},
  abstract = {Signal temporal logic (STL) and Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis are effective mathematical tools for formally analyzing the behavior of robotic systems. STL is a specification language that uses a combination of logic and temporal operators to precisely express real-valued and time-dependent requirements on system behaviors. While recursively defined STL specifications are extremely expressive and controller synthesis methods exist, so far there has not been work that quantifies the set of states from which STL formulas can be satisfied. HJ reachability, on the other hand, is a method for computing the reachable set, that is the set of states from which a system is able to reach a goal while satisfying state and control constraints. While reasoning about system requirements through sets of states is useful for predetermining whether it is possible to satisfy desired system properties as well as obtaining state feedback controllers, so far the applicability of HJ reachability has been limited to relatively simple reach-avoid specifications. In this paper, we merge STL and HJ reachability into a single framework that combines the key advantage of both methods ? expressiveness of specifications and set quantification. To do this, we establish a correspondence between temporal and reachability operators, and utilize the idea of least-restrictive feasible controller sets (LRFCSs) to break down controller synthesis for complex STL formulas into a sequence of reachability and elementary set operations. LRFCSs are crucial for avoiding controller conflicts among the different reachability operations. In addition, the synthesized state feedback controllers are guaranteed to satisfy STL specifications if determined to be possible by our framework, and violate specifications minimally if not. We demonstrate our method through numerical simulations and robotic experiments.},

  abstract = {Mixed-integer convex programming (MICP) has seen significant algorithmic and hardware improvements with several orders of magnitude solve time speedups compared to 25 years ago. Despite these advances, MICP has been rarely applied to real-world robotic control because the solution times are still too slow for online applications. In this work, we extend the machine learning optimizer (MLOPT) framework to solve MICPs arising in robotics at very high speed. MLOPT encodes the combinatorial part of the optimal solution into a strategy. Using data collected from offline problem solutions, we train a multiclass classifier to predict the optimal strategy given problem-specific parameters such as states or obstacles. Compared to previous approaches, we use task-specific strategies and prune redundant ones to significantly reduce the number of classes the predictor has to select from, thereby greatly improving scalability. Given the predicted strategy, the control task becomes a small convex optimization problem that we can solve in milliseconds. Numerical experiments on a cart-pole system with walls, a free-flying space robot and task-oriented grasps show that our method provides not only 1 to 2 orders of magnitude speedups compared to state-of-the-art solvers but also performance close to the globally optimal MICP solution.},

CoCo consists of a two-stage approach. In the offline phase, we train a neural network classifier that maps the problem parameters to a (logical strategy), which we define as the discrete arguments and relaxed big-M constraints associated with the optimal solution for that problem. Online, the classifier is applied to select a candidate logical strategy given new problem parameters; applying this logical strategy allows us to solve the original MICP as a convex optimization problem. We show through numerical experiments how CoCo finds near optimal solutions to MICPs arising in robot planning and control with 1 to 2 orders of magnitude solution speedup compared to other data-driven approaches and solvers.},

  abstract = {Advances in sensing and actuation capabilities have allowed for the proliferation of robots across many fields, including aerial, industrial, and automotive applications. A driving factor in being able to deploy such robots in everyday applications is algorithms that imbue real-time decision making capabilities. Such decision-making capabilities can be formulated using the modeling framework of optimization programs. However, such optimization-based approaches are still limited by computational resources available on robot platforms. For example, in many aerospace applications, spacecraft robotic systems are equipped with embedded computers much less capable than the hardware typically used to solve such optimization algorithms. Thus, there is a pressing need to be able to scale and extend optimization-based planning and control algorithms to robotics applications with severely constrained computational resources. In this work, we turn towards recent advances in nonlinear optimization, supervised learning, and control theory to accelerate solving optimization-based controllers for online deployment. We then show how data-driven approaches can exploit powerful computational resources offline to learn the underlying structure of optimization problems such that the online decision making problem can be reduced to an approximate problem that is much easier to solve on embedded computers. In the first part of this dissertation, we present a local trajectory optimization framework known as Guaranteed Sequential Trajectory Optimization (GuSTO) that provides a theoretically-motivated algorithm that iteratively solves a series of convex optimization problems until convergence. We demonstrate how this framework can accommodate a broad class of trajectory optimization problems, including free-final time, free final-state, and problems on a manifold. We further discuss how GuSTO enables new applications, specifically in the domain of spacecraft robotic manipulation, and discuss the development of a novel gecko-inspired adhesive robot gripper design for the Astrobee assistive free-flying robot. In the second part of this dissertation, we turn towards global trajectory optimization problems, specifically those that can be formulated as mixed-integer convex programs (MICPs). MICPs are a popular modeling framework that can be used to model planning and control problems that are inherently combinatorial or discrete. However, existing algorithms fall short in being able to provide reliable solution approaches that can be deployed for real-time applications (i.e., 10-100Hz computation rates) on embedded systems. In this work, we turn towards data-driven approaches that can be used to find high quality feasible solutions to such MICPs and present Combinatorial Offline, Convex Online (CoCo). We demonstrate how such approaches can leverage the underlying structure of optimal control problems and compare our proposed approach against state-of-the-art commercial solvers.

  abstract = {The recent decadal survey report for planetary science (compiled by the National Research Council) has prioritized three main areas for planetary exploration: (1) the characterization of the early Solar system history, (2) the search for planetary habitats, and (3) an improved understanding about the nature of planetary processes. A growing number of ground and space observations suggest that small bodies are ideally suited for addressing all these three priorities. In parallel, several technological advances have been recently made for microgravity rovers, penetrators, and MEMS-based instruments. Motivated by these findings and new technologies, the objective of this paper is to study the expected science return of spatially-extended in-situ exploration at small bodies, as a function of surface covered and in the context of the key science priorities identified by the decadal survey report. Specifically, targets within the scope of our analysis belong to three main classes: main belt asteroids and irregular satellites, Near Earth Objects, and comets. For each class of targets, we identify the corresponding science objectives for potential future exploration, we discuss the types of measurements and instruments that would be required, and we discuss mission architectures (with an emphasis on spatially-extended in-situ exploration) to achieve such objectives. Then, we characterize (notionally) how the science return for two reference targets would scale with the amount (and type) of surface that is expected to be covered by a robotic mobile platform. The conclusion is that spatially-extended in-situ information about the chemical and physical heterogeneity of small bodies has the potential to lead to a much improved understanding about their origin, evolution, and astrobiological relevance.},

We provide conditions for the structure of the underlying MDP ensuring that approximations for the exact problem can be derived and solved efficiently. Our findings are novel inasmuch as average value at risk has not previously been considered in association with the total cost criterion. Our method is demonstrated in a rapid deployment scenario, whereby a robot is tasked with the objective of reaching a target location within a temporal deadline where increased speed is associated with increased probability of failure. We demonstrate that the proposed algorithm not only produces a risk averse policy reducing the probability of exceeding the expected temporal deadline, but also provides the statistical distribution of costs, thus offering a valuable analysis tool.},

  booktitle    = proc_IEEE_AC,
  year         = {2017},
  abstract = {Removing large orbital debris in a safe, robust, and cost-effective manner is a long-standing challenge, having serious implications for LEO satellite safety and access to space. Many studies have focused on the deorbit of spent rocket bodies (R/Bs) as an achievable and high-priority first step. However, major difficulties arise from the R/Bs' residual tumble and lack of traditional docking/grasping fixtures. Previously investigated docking strategies often require complex and risky approach maneuvers or have a high chance of producing additional debris. To address this challenge, this paper investigates the use of controllable dry adhesives (CDAs), also known as gecko-inspired adhesives, as an alternative approach to R/B docking and deorbiting. CDAs are gathering interest for in-space grasping and manipulation due to their ability to controllably attach to and detach from any smooth, clean surface, including flat and curved surfaces. Such capability significantly expands the number and types of potential docking locations on a target. CDAs are also inexpensive, are space-qualified (performing well in a vacuum, in extreme temperatures, and under radiation), and can attach and detach while applying minimal force to a target surface, all important considerations for space deployment. In this paper, we investigate a notional strategy for initial capture and stabilization of a R/B having multi-axis tumble, exploiting the unique properties of CDA grippers to reduce maneuver complexity, and we propose alternatives for rigidly attaching deorbiting kits to a R/B. Simulations based on experimentally verified models of CDA grippers show that these approaches show promise as robust alternatives to previously explored methods.},

  abstract = {Despite decades of work in fast reactive planning and control, challenges remain in developing reactive motion policies on non-Euclidean manifolds and enforcing constraints while avoiding undesirable potential function local minima. This work presents a principled method for designing and fusing desired robot task behaviors into a stable robot motion policy, leveraging the geometric structure of non-Euclidean manifolds, which are prevalent in robot configuration and task spaces. Our Pullback Bundle Dynamical Systems (PBDS) framework drives desired task behaviors and prioritizes tasks using separate position-dependent and position/velocity-dependent Riemannian metrics, respectively, thus simplifying individual task design and modular composition of tasks. For enforcing constraints, we provide a class of metric-based tasks, eliminating local minima by imposing non-conflicting potential functions only for goal region attraction. We also provide a geometric optimization problem for combining tasks inspired by Riemannian Motion Policies (RMPs) that reduces to a simple least-squares problem, and we show that our approach is geometrically well-defined. We demonstrate the PBDS framework on the sphere S2 and at 300-500 Hz on a manipulator arm, and we provide task design guidance and an open-source Julia library implementation. Overall, this work presents a fast, easy-to-use framework for generating motion policies without unwanted potential function local minima on general manifolds.},

  school       = ios_univ_Stanford_AA,
  year         = {2021},
  abstract = {Robots operating in the unstructured environments of the real world must contend with at least two sources of geometric complexity: (1) the differential geometric complexity of robot configuration spaces and task spaces, which can in practice be general non-Euclidean manifolds, and (2) the complexity of the geometric shape of robot links and obstacles in the environment, which have infinite variability and are often highly nonconvex. Mature robot autonomy requires algorithms that can tackle these sources of geometric complexity with precision and at real-time control and planning speeds. This thesis focuses on bridging existing gaps in previous methods to meet these needs. In particular, to address differential geometric complexity in motion design, we first present a framework called Multi-Task Pullback Bundle Dynamical Systems (PBDS), which is a geometric control methodology for forming fast composable geometric motion policies, respecting simultaneous robotic tasks on non-Euclidean robot and task manifolds. Second, we present an embedded sequential convex programming approach which exploits differential geometric structure to eliminate explicit manifold-type constraints in trajectory optimization while still guaranteeing final satisfaction of these constraints. Together, these approaches correctly enforce the differential geometric structure of robot planning and control problems while maintaining similar or greater computational efficiency compared to past approaches. Finally, we address the shape complexity of robot links and obstacles by repurposing hardware-accelerated ray-tracing (i.e., ray-tracing cores) for rapidly forming collision avoidance constraints in trajectory optimization, particularly targeting complex robot and obstacle triangle mesh representations. This enables robot motion designers to leverage the full complexity of robot and obstacle geometries at speeds orders of magnitude faster than currently available collision-checking libraries, while leveraging recently-developed ray-tracing cores which have previously had little utility in the robot autonomy stack.},

  booktitle    = proc_AIAA_GNC,

  abstract = {In a pullout maneuver an initially diving aircraft is returned to level flight. Depending on the initial condition, aircraft characteristics and control inputs, altitude loss may be significant and minimizing it can be important to avoid collision with the ground. A motivating example is that of stall/spin recoveries, where the pullout represents a majority of the total altitude lost. This paper presents a solution of the minimal altitude loss pullout maneuver by posing it as an infinite horizon optimal control problem and solving it using dynamic programming techniques on a reduced-order point mass model for a low-wing general aviation aircraft. The computed optimal policy results in a ?bang-bang? type controller, typical of shortest path problems, with maximum lift coefficient and bank rate applied at each point in time. The effect of maximum lift coefficient on the minimum altitude loss is analyzed, showing that attaining the highest lift coefficient possible throughout the pullout is critical. Based on these results a pullout flight control system is designed, with the optimal policy acting as an outer loop issuing commands to two inner loops that track lift coefficient and roll rate, respectively. The proposed pullout controller is tested on 6 DOF simulations, and shown to be effective at recovering the aircraft with close to optimal altitude loss.},

This paper surveys recent concepts and algorithms for dynamic vehicle routing (DVR), that is, for the automatic planning of optimal multi-vehicle routes to perform tasks that are generated over time by an exogenous process. We consider a rich variety of scenarios relevant for robotic applications. We begin by reviewing the basic DVR problem: demands for service arrive at random locations at random times and a vehicle travels to provide on-site service while minimizing the expected wait time of the demands. Next, we treat different multi-vehicle scenarios based on different models for demands (e.g., demands with different priority levels and impatient demands), vehicles (e.g., motion constraints, communication and sensing capabilities), and tasks. The performance criterion used in these scenarios is either the expected wait time of the demands or the fraction of demands serviced successfully. In each specific DVR scenario, we adopt a rigorous technical approach that relies upon methods from queueing theory, combinatorial optimization and stochastic geometry. First, we establish fundamental limits on the achievable performance, including limits on stability and quality of service. Second, we design algorithms, and provide provable guarantees on their performance with respect to the fundamental limits.},

  abstract = {Verifying that input-output relationships of a neural network conform to prescribed operational specifications is a key enabler towards deploying these networks in safety-critical applications. Semidefinite programming (SDP)-based approaches to Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) network verification transcribe this problem into an optimization problem, where the accuracy of any such formulation reflects the level of fidelity in how the neural network computation is represented, as well as the relaxations of intractable constraints. While the literature contains much progress on improving the tightness of SDP formulations while maintaining tractability, comparatively little work has been devoted to the other extreme, i.e., how to most accurately capture the original verification problem before SDP relaxation. In this work, we develop an exact, convex formulation of verification as a completely positive program (CPP), and provide analysis showing that our formulation is minimal---the removal of any constraint fundamentally misrepresents the neural network computation. We leverage our formulation to provide a unifying view of existing approaches, and give insight into the source of large relaxation gaps observed in some cases.},

Nevertheless, existing algorithms for distributed optimization generally do not exploit the locality structure of the problem, requiring all agents to compute or exchange the full set of decision variables. In this paper, we develop a rigorous notion of "locality" that relates the structural properties of a linearly-constrained convex optimization problem (in particular, the sparsity structure of the constraint matrix and the objective function) to the amount of information that agents should exchange to compute an arbitrarily high-quality approximation to the problem from a cold-start. We leverage the notion of locality to develop a locality-aware distributed optimization algorithm, and we show that, for problems where individual agents only require to know a small portion of the optimal solution, the algorithm requires very limited inter-agent communication. Numerical results show that the convergence rate of our algorithm is directly explained by the locality parameter proposed, and that the proposed theoretical bounds are remarkably tight.},

The revolutions in AI hold tremendous capacity to augment human achievements in surgery, but robust integration of deep learning algorithms with high-ï¿½?delity surgical simulation remains a challenge. We present a novel application of reinforcement learning (RL) for automating surgical maneuvers in a graphical simulation. Methods. In the Unity3D game engine, the Machine Learning-Agents package was integrated with the NVIDIA FleX particle simulator for developing autonomously behaving RL-trained scissors. Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) was used to reward movements and desired behavior such as movement along desired trajectory and optimized cutting maneuvers along the deformable tissue-like object. Constant and proportional reward functions were tested, and TensorFlow analytics was used to informed hyperparameter tuning and evaluate performance. Results.  RL-trained scissors reliably manipulated the rendered tissue that was simulated with soft-tissue properties. A desirable trajectory of the autonomously behaving scissors was achieved along 1 axis. Proportional rewards performed better compared to constant rewards. Cumulative reward and PPO metrics did not consistently improve across RL-trained scissors in the setting for movement across 2 axes (horizontal and depth). Conclusion.  Game engines hold promising potential for the design and implementation of RL-based solutions to simulated surgical subtasks. Task completion was sufï¿½?ciently achieved in one-dimensional movement in simulations with and without tissue-rendering. Further work is needed to optimize network architecture and parameter tuning for increasing complexity.},

However, the theoretical analysis of SCP has received comparatively limited attention, and it is often restricted to discrete-time formulations. In this paper, we present a unifying theoretical analysis of a fairly general class of SCP procedures for continuous-time optimal control problems. In addition to the derivation of convergence guarantees in a continuous-time setting, our analysis reveals two new numerical and practical insights. First, we show how one can more easily account for manifold-type constraints, which are a defining feature of optimal control of mechanical systems. Second, we show how our theoretical analysis can be leveraged to accelerate SCP-based optimal control methods by infusing techniques from indirect optimal control.},

GuSTO generalizes earlier SCP-based methods for trajectory optimization (by addressing, for example, goal region constraints and problems with either fixed or free final time), and enjoys theoretical convergence guarantees in terms of convergence to, at least, a stationary point. The theoretical analysis is further leveraged to devise an accelerated implementation of GuSTO, which originally infuses ideas from indirect optimal control into an SCP context. Numerical experiments on a variety of trajectory optimization setups show that GuSTO generally outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches in terms of success rates, solution quality, and computation times.},

Yet, most SCP-based methods for trajectory optimization are restricted to Euclidean settings, which precludes their application to problem instances where one needs to reason about manifold-type constraints (that is, constraints, such as loop closure, which restrict the motion of a system to a subset of the ambient space). The aim of this paper is to fill this gap by extending SCP-based trajectory optimization methods to a manifold setting. The key insight is to leverage geometric embeddings to lift a manifold-constrained trajectory optimization problem into an equivalent problem defined over a space enjoying Euclidean structure. This insight allows one to extend existing SCP methods to a manifold setting in a fairly natural way. In particular, we present an SCP algorithm for manifold problems with theoretical guarantees that resemble those derived for the Euclidean setting, and demonstrate its practical performance via numerical experiments.},

Algorithms within this framework are evaluated based on (1) model performance throughout mission lifetime and (2) cumulative costs associated with labeling and model retraining. We provide an open-source benchmark of a satellite pose estimation model trained on images of a satellite in space and deployed in novel scenarios (e.g., different backgrounds or misbehaving pixels), where algorithms are evaluated on their ability to maintain high performance by retraining on a subset of inputs. We also propose a novel algorithm to select a diverse subset of inputs for labeling, by characterizing the information gain from an input using Bayesian uncertainty quantification and choosing a subset that maximizes collective information gain using concepts from batch active learning. We show that our algorithm outperforms others on the benchmark, e.g., achieves comparable performance to an algorithm that labels 100% of inputs, while only labeling 50% of inputs, resulting in low costs and high performance over the mission lifetime.},

  year      = {2023},
  note      = {Submitted},
  abstract  = {Real-time optimal control of high-dimensional, nonlinear systems remains a challenging task due to the computational intractability of their models. While several model-reduction and learning-based approaches for constructing low-dimensional surrogates of the original system have been proposed in the literature, these approaches suffer from fundamental issues which limit their application in real-world scenarios. Namely, they typically lack generalizability to different control tasks, ability to trade dimensionality for accuracy, and ability to preserve the structure of the dynamics. Recently, we proposed to extract low-dimensional dynamics on Spectral Submanifolds (SSMs) to overcome these issues and validated our approach in a highly accurate simulation environment. In this manuscript, we extend our framework to a real-world setting by employing time-delay embeddings to embed SSMs in an observable space of appropriate dimension. This allows us to learn highly accurate, low-dimensional dynamics purely from observational data. We show that these innovations extend Spectral Submanifold Reduction (SSMR) to real-world applications and showcase the effectiveness of SSMR on a soft robotic system.},

  abstract  = {Modeling and control of high-dimensional, nonlinear robotic systems remains a challenging task. While various model- and learning-based approaches have been proposed to address these challenges, they broadly lack generalizability to different control tasks and rarely preserve the structure of the dynamics. In this work, we propose a new, data-driven approach for extracting low-dimensional models from data using Spectral Submanifold Reduction (SSMR). In contrast to other data-driven methods which fit dynamical models to training trajectories, we identify the dynamics on generic, low-dimensional attractors embedded in the full phase space of the robotic system. This allows us to obtain computationally-tractable models for control which preserve the system's dominant dynamics and better track trajectories radically different from the training data. We demonstrate the superior performance and generalizability of SSMR in dynamic trajectory tracking tasks vis-a-vis the state of the art.},

  abstract = {The future exploration of small Solar System bodies will, in part, depend on the availability of mobility platforms capable of performing both large surface coverage and short traverses to specific locations. Weak gravitational fields, however, make the adoption of traditional mobility systems difficult. In this paper we present a planetary mobility platform (called "spacecraft/rover hybrid") that relies on internal actuation. A hybrid is a small (~5 kg), multifaceted robot enclosing three mutually orthogonal flywheels and surrounded by external spikes or contact surfaces. By accelerating/decelerating the flywheels and by exploiting the low-gravity environment, such a platform can perform both long excursions (by hopping) and short, precise traverses (through controlled "tumbles"). This concept has the potential to lead to small, quasi-expendable, yet maneuverable rovers that are robust as they have no external moving parts. In the first part of the paper we characterize the dynamics of such platforms (including fundamental limitations of performance) and we discuss control and planning algorithms. In the second part, we discuss the development of a prototype and present experimental results both in simulations and on physical test stands emulating low-gravity environments. Collectively, our results lay the foundations for the design of internally-actuated rovers with controlled mobility (as opposed to random hopping motion).},

A sampling-based motion planning algorithm then leverages such a precomputed roadmap to compute online an obstacle-free trajectory. Machine learning techniques are employed to minimize the number of online solutions to boundary value problems required to compute the neighborhoods of the start state and goal regions. This approach is demonstrated to reduce online planning times up to six orders of magnitude. Simulation results are presented and discussed. Problem-specific framework modifications are then discussed that would allow further computation time reductions.},

  year         = {2014},
  abstract = {Assessing reachability for a dynamical system, that is deciding whether a certain state is reachable from a given initial state within a given cost threshold, is a central concept in controls, robotics, and optimization. Direct approaches to assess reachability involve the solution to a two-point boundary value problem (2PBVP) between a pair of states. Alternative, indirect approaches involve the characterization of reachable sets as level sets of the value function of an appropriate optimal control problem. Both methods solve the problem accurately, but are computationally intensive and do no appear amenable to real-time implementation for all but the simplest cases. In this work, we leverage machine learning techniques to devise query-based algorithms for the approximate, yet real-time solution of the reachability problem. Specifically, we show that with a training set of pre-solved 2PBVP problems, one can accurately classify the cost-reachable sets of a differentially-constrained system using either (1) locally-weighted linear regression or (2) support vector machines. This novel, query-based approach is demonstrated on two systems: the Dubins car and a deep-space spacecraft. Classification errors on the order of 10\% (and often significantly less) are achieved with average execution times on the order of milliseconds, representing 4 orders-of-magnitude improvement over exact methods. The proposed algorithms could find application in a variety of time-critical robotic applications, where the driving factor is computation time rather than optimality.},

As products of this work, three contributions are discussed in detail in this thesis. The first contribution is the novel application of machine learning for rapid approximation of reachable sets for dynamical systems. The second contribution is the synthesis of machine learning, sampling-based motion planning, and optimal control into a cohesive planning framework that is built on an offline-online computation paradigm. The final contribution is the application of this planning framework on a quadrotor system to produce, arguably, one of the first demonstrations of fully-online kinodynamic motion planning. During physical experiments, the framework is shown to execute planning cycles at a rate 3 Hz to 5 Hz, a significant improvement over existing techniques. For the quadrotor, a simplified dynamics model is used during the planning phase to accelerate online computation. A trajectory smoothing phase, which leverages the differentially flat nature of quadrotor dynamics, is then implemented to guarantee a dynamically feasible trajectory. An event-based replanning structure is implemented to handle the case of dynamic, even adversarial, obstacles. A locally reactive control layer, inspired by potential fields methods, is added to the framework to help minimizes replanning events and produce graceful avoidance maneuvers in the presence of high speed obstacles.},

HoverHaptics highlights three affordances of quadcopters that enable these rich haptic interactions: (1) dynamic positioning of passive haptics, (2) texture mapping, and (3) animating passive props. We identify inherent challenges of hovering encountered-type haptic devices, such as their limited speed, inadequate control accuracy, and safety concerns. We then detail our approach for tackling these challenges, including the use of display techniques, visuo-haptic illusions, and collision avoidance. We conclude by describing a preliminary study (n = 9) to better understand the subjective user experience when interacting with a quadcopter in virtual reality using these techniques.},

Therefore, coping with OOD data is an important challenge on the path towards trustworthy learning-enabled open-world autonomy. In this paper, we aim to demystify the topic of OOD data and its associated challenges in the context of data-driven robotic systems, drawing connections to emerging paradigms in the ML community that study the effect of OOD data on learned models in isolation. We argue that as roboticists, we should reason about the overall system-level competence of a robot as it performs tasks in OOD conditions. We highlight key research questions around this system-level view of OOD problems to guide future research toward safe and reliable learning-enabled autonomy.},

  abstract = {When we rely on deep-learned models for robotic perception, we must recognize that these models may behave unreliably on inputs dissimilar from the training data, compromising the closed-loop system's safety. This raises fundamental questions on how we can assess confidence in perception systems and to what extent we can take safety-preserving actions when external environmental changes degrade our perception model's performance. Therefore, we present a framework to certify the safety of a perception-enabled system deployed in novel contexts. To do so, we leverage robust model predictive control (MPC) to control the system using the perception estimates while maintaining the feasibility of a safety-preserving fallback plan that does not rely on the perception system. In addition, we calibrate a runtime monitor using recently proposed conformal prediction techniques to certifiably detect when the perception system degrades beyond the tolerance of the MPC controller, resulting in an end-to-end safety assurance. We show that this control framework and calibration technique allows us to certify the system's safety with orders of magnitudes fewer samples than required to retrain the perception network when we deploy in a novel context on a photo-realistic aircraft taxiing simulator. Furthermore, we illustrate the safety-preserving behavior of the MPC on simulated examples of a quadrotor.},

Whereas previous language-based planners only consider the feasibility of individual skills, Text2Motion actively resolves geometric dependencies spanning skill sequences by performing geometric feasibility planning during its search. We evaluate our method on a suite of problems that require long-horizon reasoning, interpretation of abstract goals, and handling of partial affordance perception. Our experiments show that Text2Motion can solve these challenging problems with a success rate of 82%, while prior state-of-the-art language-based planning methods only achieve 13%. Text2Motion thus provides promising generalization characteristics to semantically diverse sequential manipulation tasks with geometric dependencies between skills.},

  note         = {Submitted},
  abstract = {As robots acquire increasingly sophisticated skills and see increasingly complex and varied environments, the threat of an edge case or anomalous failure is ever present. For example, Tesla cars have seen interesting failure modes ranging from autopilot disengagements due to inactive traffic lights carried by trucks to phantom braking caused by images of stop signs on roadside billboards. These system-level failures are not due to failures of any individual component of the autonomy stack but rather system-level deficiencies in semantic reasoning. Such edge cases, which we call \textit{semantic anomalies}, are simple for a human to disentangle yet require insightful reasoning. To this end, we study the application of large language models (LLMs), endowed with broad contextual understanding and reasoning capabilities, to recognize these edge semantic cases. We introduce a monitoring framework for semantic anomaly detection in vision-based policies to do so. Our experiments evaluate this framework in monitoring a learned policy for object manipulation and a finite state machine policy for autonomous driving and demonstrate that an LLM-based monitor can serve as a proxy for human reasoning. Finally, we provide an extended discussion on the strengths and weaknesses of this approach and motivate a research outlook on how we can further use foundation models for semantic anomaly detection.},
