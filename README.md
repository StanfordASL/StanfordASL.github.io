# StanfordASL
The ASL's website, hosted on GitHub Pages!

## System Setup
Before developing/publishing the website, you may need to install various system dependencies, specifically `rake` (a build automation tool) and `bundler` (a Ruby dependency manager, which will install all further dependencies listed in [`Gemfile`](Gemfile)). On a Ubuntu system, installing these dependencies looks something like
```shell
sudo apt install rake ruby-dev
sudo gem install bundler
bundle install  # from the base directory of a cloned repository
```

## Developing the Website
To develop, **you must do your work on the `source` branch**. `master` is autogenerated via a `rake` job (you can see the details in `Rakefile`). The `source` branch contains all the Jekyll code. To do this, simply execute
```shell
git checkout source
```

Additional **high-level** commands include
```shell
rake preview # <- asks jekyll to build the site and host it locally 
```
Additional **low-level** commands include
```shell
rake check # <- checks whether the local repo is up to date
rake build # <- asks jekyll to build the site from its source
rake deploy # <- copies generated website from source to master
```

## Publishing the Website
When you've made the desired changes and are in the `source` branch, simply execute:
```shell
rake publish
```
This will rebuild the site, commit your changes to the `source` branch, and deploy the generated site (located in `_site`) to the `master` branch. GitHub Pages will pick up on this change and update `stanfordasl.github.io` with the new changes.

**NOTE**: This GitHub Pages link is where the `asl.stanford.edu` and `asl-origin.stanford.edu` proxies point to, so this repository and the corresponding GitHub Page is the "actual" website.
