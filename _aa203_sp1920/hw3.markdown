In this homework you will investigate the ideas of dynamic programming and optimal control in continuous time. In particular, this problem set includes questions on continuous time LQR as well as LQG and application of the HJB equation. You will also look at reachability methods, as well as a first step into direct methods for trajectory optimization.
