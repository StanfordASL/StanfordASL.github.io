The goal of this homework is to build intuition and practical experience with dynamic programming. This homework explores several different applications of dynamic programming, from stochastic discrete state space systems to LQR problems. It concludes with applying iterative LQR to compute a "swing up" trajectory for a cartpole system, the first difficult nonlinear optimal control problem we will investigate in this class.
