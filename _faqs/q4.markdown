question: "I'm interested in robotics in general, how do I find out more about what the ASL does?"
---

The easiest way is to check out our <a class="faq-link" href="/projects/" target="_blank">projects page</a> and attend our lab meetings. Information about the lab meetings will be announced on <a class="faq-link" href="https://mailman.stanford.edu/mailman/listinfo/stanford-asl" target="_blank">this mailing list</a>. You will get to learn about topics that the lab is interested in, and an opportunity to meet students in the lab.

Another way to learn more about the ASL is to take the classes I teach --- AA274: Principles of Robotic Autonomy, and AA203: Introduction to Optimal Control Theory.
