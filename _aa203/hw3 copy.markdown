The goal of this homework is to gain experience with control techniques that account for constraints. Primarily, the homework focuses on model predictive control (MPC), a very popular optimal control technique, and it's properties. Additionally, problem 1 revisits the swing-up problem with input constraints and requires implementing sequential convex programming (SCP) and the last problem introduces an adaptive control method: model reference adaptive control (MRAC)
